## Lab activity 2 - Miller and Haden data

1. Loading the relevant libraries
```{r libraries}
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
```
2. Read in the data
```{r libraries}
mh <- read_csv("MillerHadenData.csv")
```

3. 
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
