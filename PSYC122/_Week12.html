<p>Today we will continue to look at correlation as a measure of association between two numerical variables. We will review assumptions associated with correlation, discuss some issues important to be aware of when interpreting correlation results and finally, we’ll talk about intercorrelation.</p>

<p>The reading that accompanies the lectures this week is again from <a href="https://onesearch.lancaster-university.uk/permalink/f/cssk39/44LAN_ALMA_DS51180136050001221"><strong>chapter 9 of the core text by Howell (2017)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Rougly, <strong>last week</strong> we covered the material in sections 9.1 to 9.4, as well as sections 9.8 to 9.11 and section 9.15. <strong>This week,</strong> we’ll cover the material in sections 9.5 to 9.7, and sections 9.12 to 9.13. Even if a section is not mentioned here, all of chapter 9 is relevant.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-wk12-prelab-activities">Pre-lab activities</h2>
<p>After having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.</p>
<section id="pre-lab-activity-1-data-wrangling-with-dplyr" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pre-lab-activity-1-data-wrangling-with-dplyr">Pre-lab activity 1: Data-wrangling with dplyr</h3>
<p>Data comes in lots of different formats. One of the most common formats is that of a two-dimensional table (the two dimensions being rows and columns). Usually, each row stands for a separate observation (e.g.&nbsp;a participant), and each column stands for a different variable (e.g.&nbsp;a response, category, or group). A key benefit of tabular data is that it allows you to store different types of data-numerical measurements, alphanumeric labels, categorical descriptors-all in one place.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that scientists actually spend far more of time cleaning and preparing their data than they spend actually analysing it. This means completing tasks such as cleaning up bad values, changing the structure of tables, merging information stored in separate tables, reducing the data down to a subset of observations, and producing data summaries. Some have estimated that up to 80% of time spent on data analysis involves such data preparation tasks (Dasu &amp; Johnson, 2003)!</p>
<p>Many people seem to operate under the assumption that the only option for data cleaning is the painstaking and time-consuming cutting and pasting of data within a spreadsheet program like Excel. We have witnessed students and colleagues waste days, weeks, and even months manually transforming their data in Excel, cutting, copying, and pasting data. Fixing up your data by hand is not only a terrible use of your time, but it is error-prone and not reproducible. Additionally, in this age where we can easily collect massive datasets online, you will not be able to organise, clean, and prepare these by hand.</p>
<p><strong>In short, you will not thrive as a psychologist if you do not learn some key data wrangling skills.</strong> Although every dataset presents unique challenges, there are some systematic principles you should follow that will make your analyses easier, less error-prone, more efficient, and more reproducible.</p>
<p>The functions you’ll need in lab activity 2 include <code>select()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>mutate()</code>, <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code> from the dplyr package.</p>
<p>You’ve used these functions before, but the following ‘recipes’ summarise what each one does and how to use it.</p>

<!-- In this lab, you'll gain understanding of and practice with: -->
<!-- -   constructing and interpreting histograms and qq-plots -->
<!-- -   constructing and interpreting a matrix of scatterplots -->
<!-- -   running intercorrelation analysis and interpret the results -->
<!-- -   correct for multiple comparisons when running intercorrelation analysis -->
<!-- -   constructing a correlation matrix in APA format -->
<!-- -   when and why to apply correlation analysis to answers questions in psychological science -->
<!-- ### Lab activity 1: Assumptions of Correlation Analysis -->
<!-- #### Question 1 -->
<!-- Correlation would be an appropriate form on analysis for researchers interested in the relationship between: -->
<!-- a.  Dog (breed) and height (cm) of owner -->
<!-- b.  Speed of swimming (mph) and area of tank (cm) -->
<!-- c.  Number of cows sitting and rain fall (mm) -->
<!-- d.  Total llama saliva (ml) expelled and gender of visitors -->
<!-- e.  b and d -->
<!-- f.  b and c -->
<!-- #### Question 2 -->
<!-- When would you use Spearman's rho analysis instead of Pearson's r? -->
<!-- a.  When there are clear outliers in the data -->
<!-- b.  When the data is not normally distributed -->
<!-- c.  When the relationship between X and Y is curvilinear -->
<!-- d.  a and b -->
<!-- #### Question 3 -->
<!-- Using the histograms and qq-plots below, which of these variables satisfies the normality assumption? Explain your answers. -->
<!-- **Histogram non-words** ![](images/wk2/hist_nonWords.png) -->
<!-- **QQ-plot non-words** ![](images/wk2/qq_nonWords.png) -->
<!-- **Histogram words** ![](images/wk2/hist_words.png) -->
<!-- **QQ-plot words** ![](images/wk2/qq_words.png) -->
<!-- **Histogram vocabulary** ![](images/wk2/hist_vocab.png) -->
<!-- **QQ-plot non-words** ![](images/wk2/qq_vocab.png) -->
<!-- #### Question 4 -->
<!-- Why should correlation analysis not be conducted on variables with a curvilinear relationship? -->
<!-- ### Lab activity 2: Attitudes towards vaping -->
<!-- Great work so far! Now we really want to see what you can do yourself. In this activity we'll use real data on implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping. You'll need the data file `VapingData.csv` and the R-script `122_wk12_labAct2_template.R` that you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 2. -->
<!-- #### Background -->
<!-- **Explicit attitudes** were measured via a questionnaire where higher scores indicated a positive attitude towards vaping (`VapingQuestionaireScore`). **Implicit attitudes** were measured through an Implicit Association Test (IAT) using images of Vaping and Kitchen utensils and associating them with positive and negative words. -->
<!-- The IAT works on the principal that associations that go together (that are congruent, e.g. warm and sun) should be quicker to respond to than associations that do not go together (that are incongruent, e.g. warm and ice). You can read up more on the procedure on [**the Noba Project**](https://nobaproject.com/modules/research-methods-in-social-psychology) which has a good description of the procedure under the section "Subtle/Nonsconscious Research Methods". -->
<!-- For this exercise, you need to know that "Block 3" in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards congruent associations, pairing positive words with Kitchen utensils and negative words with Vaping. "Block 5" in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards incongruent associations, pairing positive words with Vaping and negative words with Kitchen Utensils. As such, if reaction times were longer in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is negative (i.e. congruent associations are quicker than incongruent associations). However, if reaction times were quicker in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is positive (i.e. incongruent associations were quicker than congruent associations). The difference between reaction times in Block5 and Block3 is called the participants' IAT score. -->
<!-- #### Step 0: Clean your environment -->
<!-- Before you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. You can do this by clicking on the broom icon at the top of the environment window, or you can use the code below. -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Use the code snippet below to clear the environment. **TIP**: If you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a 'copy to clipboard' icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script. ![](images/wk2/copy.png) -->
<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- rm(list=ls())                             -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- #### Step 1: Set your working directory -->
<!-- Now, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data file (`VapingData.csv`). -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Use the code snippet below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the 'Files' pane on the right. Does it contain the data file ('VapingData.csv')? -->
<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- getwd() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- If your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the 'Files' pane, click 'More' and then on 'Set as working directory'. -->
<!-- ![](images/wk2/more_workingDirectory.png) -->
<!-- #### Step 2: Load packages -->
<!-- Before we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we'll need `broom`, `car`, `Hmisc`, `lsr` and `tidyverse`. -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Load the relevant libraries. **HINT**: Use the `library()` function. -->
<!-- #### Step 3: Read in the data -->
<!-- The data file we'll be working with is `VapingData.csv` -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Read in the data file (using the `read_csv()` function) and store it in an object called `dat`. Have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it. You have 8 columns. Reaction times and Accuracy scores for Blocks 3 and 5 as well as the Explicit Vaping Questionnaire scores, Sex and Age, for each participant. -->
<!-- **QUESTION 1:** For how many participants do we have data? -->
<!-- #### Step 4: Data wrangling -->
<!-- The data are not in a shape yet that we can actually use for our analysis. We'll have to do some 'data wrangling to knock them into shape. We need to take the following into account: -->
<!-- 1.  Accuracy was calculated as proportion and as such can't go above 1.Participants entered their own data so some might have made a mistake. Remove participants who had an accuracy greater than 1 in either Block 3 or Block 5 as we are unclear on the accuracy of these values. -->
<!-- 2.  We also only want participants who were paying attention so best remove anybody whose average accuracy score across Blocks 3 and 5 was less than 80%. Note - this value is arbitrary and if you wanted, in your own experiment, you could use a more relaxed or strict cut-off based on other studies or guidance. Note that these decisions should be set out at the start of your research as part of your pre-registration or as part of your Registered Report. Finally, in this instance, remember, the values are in proportions not percentages (so 80% will be .8). -->
<!-- 3.  Now that we have removed data points that were the result of data entry mistakes or came from participants who didn't pay attention during the task, we create an IAT score for participants by subtracting Block 3 reaction times (RT) from Block 5 reaction times (IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT). -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does. -->
<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- dat <- dat %>%  -->
<!--   filter(IAT_BLOCK3_Acc < 1) %>% -->
<!--   filter(IAT_BLOCK5_Acc < 1) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(IAT_ACC = (IAT_BLOCK3_Acc + IAT_BLOCK5_Acc)/2) %>% -->
<!--   filter(IAT_ACC > .8) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(IAT_RT = IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- **QUESTION 2:** For how many participants do we have data now that we have cleaned them up? -->
<!-- **QUESTION 3:** Use the information in the background description to understand how the scores relate to attitudes. What does a positive IAT_RT score reflect? What does a negative IAT_RT score reflect? What does a higher score on the 'VapingQuestionnaireScore' mean? -->
<!-- #### Step 5: Calculating descriptive statistics -->
<!-- Now that we have the variables that we need and the data cleaned up, we will create a descriptives summary of the number of people, and the means for the IAT and Vaping Questionnaire Score. -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does. -->
<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- descriptives <- dat %>% -->
<!--   summarise(n = n(), -->
<!--             mean_IAT_ACC = mean(IAT_ACC), -->
<!--             mean_IAT_RT = mean(IAT_RT), -->
<!--             mean_VPQ = mean(VapingQuestionnaireScore, na.rm = TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- **QUESTION 4:** Why might these averages be useful? Why are averages not always useful in correlations? -->
<!-- #### Step 6: Check the assumptions -->
<!-- **Variable types** -->
<!-- **QUESTION 5:** What are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables? -->
<!-- **Missing data** -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Remove participants with missing data. **HINT**: Use the `filter()` function and the `is.na()` function -->
<!-- **QUESTION 6:** How many people had missing data? -->
<!-- **Normality** -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Create histograms and qq-plots for the `IAT_RT` and `VapingQuestionnaireScore` variables. **HINT**: Use the `ggplot()` function with `geom_histogram()` and use the `qqPlot()` function (note the capital P) -->
<!-- **QUESTION 7:** What do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed? -->
<!-- **Linearity and homoscedasticity** -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Plot the relationship between IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore using a scatterplot and a line of best fit. **HINT**: For this you'll need the `ggplot()` function together with `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`. Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels. -->
<!-- **QUESTION 8:** What do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship? What does the scatterplot tell you about possible issues (outliers, range restrictions)? -->
<!-- #### Step 7: Conduct a correlation analysis -->
<!-- **QUESTION 9:** Do you need to calculate Pearson's r or Spearman's rho? -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Conduct a correlation analysis. **HINT**: Use the `cor.test()` function. You may want to use the `pull()` and the `round()` functions to get the numbers out. -->
<!-- **QUESTION 10:** Can you write up the results including the r, df, p-value and an interpretation? -->
<!-- #### Step 8: Intercorrelations -->
<!-- Finally, let's check whether either implicit or explicit attitude is associated with age. -->
<!-- First, let's create a new data frame that only includes the relevant variables. Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Don't forget to copy the code below to your script and run it. -->
<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- dat_matrix <- dat %>% -->
<!--   select(Age, IAT_RT, VapingQuestionnaireScore) %>% -->
<!--   as.data.frame(dat_matrix) # Make sure tell R that dat is a data frame -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Now, create a matrix of scatterplots. **HINT**: Use the `pairs()` function. -->
<!-- **QUESTION 11:** What do you conclude from the scatterplots? -->
<!-- > **TASK**: Finally, conduct intercorrelation (multiple correlations). **HINT**: Use the `correlate()` function. Do you need Pearson's *r* or Spearman's *rho*? Have you adjusted for multiple comparisons? -->
<!-- **QUESTION 12:** What do you conclude from the results of the correlation analysis? -->
<!-- ## Answers -->
<!-- When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. **Remember**, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. **Actively engaging** with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else's completed code... -->
<!-- The answers to the questions and the script containing the code will be available after the final lab session has taken place. -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **It is always worth thinking about which averages are informative and which are not. Knowing the average explicit attitude towards vaping could well be informative. In contrast, if you are using an ordinal scale and people use the whole of the scale then the average may just tell you the middle of the scale you are using - which you already know and really isn't that informative. So it is always worth thinking about what your descriptives are calculating.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 5.  What are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **Both can be considered continuous variables and at least at interval level.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 6.  How many people had missing data?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **8. Before we removed participants with missing data, we had 104 observations, now we have 96. So there must have been 8 participants without a score on one or the other variable.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 7.  What do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **Yes. Both histograms resemble a normal distribution (bell curve) and the open circles in the qq-plots fall within the blue stripy lines.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 8.  What do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship? What does the scatterplot tell you about possible issues (outliers, range restrictions)?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **The data look like a cloud without a clear direction. This suggests the relationship might might be weak. In terms of linearity, the scatterplot doesn't suggest any curvilinear relationships. Variance seems quite constant, but there do seem to be few people with negative IAT_RT (Implicit attitude) scores, suggesting few people held the view that vaping is positive.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 9.  Do you need to calculate Pearson's r or Spearman's rho?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **Pearson's r because the data do meet the assumptions.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 10. Can you write up the results including the r, df, p-value and an interpretation?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **Testing the hypothesis of a relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping, a Pearson correlation found no significant relationship between IAT reaction times (implicit attitude) and answers on a Vaping Questionnaire (explicit attitude), *r*(94) = -.02, *p* = .822. Overall this suggests that there is no direct relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes with regard to vaping and as such our hypothesis was not supported; we cannot reject the null hypothesis.** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 11. What do you conclude from the scatterplots?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **The scatterplots with age suggest that age is highly skewed with only a few participants older than 25. For now, let's say we'll therefore calculate Spearman's rho, rather than Pearson's *r*. That is ok for now, but if you were analysing these data for a research project, you'd want to have a closer look at the age variable (think histogram, qq-plot, and think about either collecting more data from older participants or transforming the variable (more about that next year).** -->
<!-- ::: -->
<!-- 12. What do you conclude from the results of the correlation analysis?  -->
<!-- ::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ## Answer -->
<!-- **No significant correlation with age was found.** -->
