# Welcome

Welcome to PSYC122!

This module builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in Statistics for Psychologists 1 (PSYC121). You will continue to learn and practise data handling, data processing and data visualisation, using R and R Studio. In addition, you will learn about statistical methods to test whether two variables are associated and how to implement those methods in R and R Studio. 

This page gives you access to all the materials that you will need. You will have timetabled lab classes during which you are expected to work through a series of exercises to practise that week's material. Before you come to your lab session, you should watch the lectures for that week, read the relevant book chapter and complete the pre-lab activities.

There will be class tests in weeks 15 and 20. These take place, in person, during your regular lab session.

We will cover the following topics:

Weeks 11-15: Measures of association:

-	Correlation
-	Simple regression
-	Chi-Square

Week 16-20: Putting it all together:

-	Making research flow
- Keeping your work reproducible
- From asking questions to presenting insights
