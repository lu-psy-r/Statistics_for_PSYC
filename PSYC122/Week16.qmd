## Week 16: Introduction {#sec-wk16-introduction}

Welcome to your overview of our work together.

We will complete four classes in **weeks 16-19**.

::: callout-tip
*Putting it all together*

- These classes are designed to help you to revise and to put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.
- We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts.
- This is the **Clearly understood** project.
:::

We will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of a real research project because we think that this *context* will help you to make sense of the data, and will help you to see *why* we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching.

We will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes.
This will give you the opportunity to *revise* and *consolidate* your learning.
We will *extend* your development with some new ideas, to help you to strengthen your skills.

We will observe real scientific findings using the data we will collect together.
These new findings will ultimately show health providers how to communicate their advice more effectively.

### Our learning goals

::: callout-tip
In Week 16, we will ask you to do three things.

- *First*, we will ask you to do a pre-lab activity that involves completing a survey.
- *Second*, we will ask you to do a set of practical tasks in the lab activity that are designed to consolidate your learning on *data visualization*.
- *Third*, we will ask you to think critically about potential associations between measures of individual differences and measures of how well people understand health information.
:::

Completing the survey will help you to make sense of the numbers you will be working with in the activities.
And it will help to teach you about the challenges of measurement, a key aspect of scientific thinking in psychology.

We will build practice in using correlations to test predictions about associations and *thus* to answer research questions.

## Lectures {#sec-wk16-lectures}

::: callout-tip
Before you go on to the activities, **watch* the lectures:
:::

The lecture for this week is presented in four short parts.
You can view video recordings of the lectures using Panopto, by clicking on the links shown following.

1. Overview (15 minutes): What we are doing in weeks 16-20, and *how* and *why* you will develop your critical thinking skills.

```

2. Thinking critically (11 minutes): A summary of the health communication project, and the ideas we assume to develop our hypotheses.

```

3. Thinking about associations in research (22 minutes): How we visualize and think about distributions and associations.

```

4. Interpreting, reporting and visualizing correlations (11 minutes): How we use R to estimate and test correlations.

::: callout-tip
The slides presented in the videos can be downloaded either as a web page or as a Word document.
:::

- [The slides](data/week16/122-hypotheses-assocations.html) exactly as presented (36 MB). 
- [The slides](data/week16/122-hypotheses-associations-printable-edit.docx) converted to a Word .docx (24 MB). 

You can download the web page `.html` file and click on it to open it in any browser (e.g., Bing, Chrome or Safari). The slide images are high quality so the file is quite big.

You can download the `.docx` file and click on it to open it as a Word document that you can then edit. Converting the slides to a .docx distorts some images but the benefit of conversion is that it makes it easier for you to add your notes.

## Reading: Links to other classes

We do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about PSYC122 and in other modules.

- The lectures in *PSYC123* on: the scientific method; reliability and validity; experimental design, especially between-subjects studies; hypothesis testing; and precise hypotheses.
- The lecture in *PSYC122* on correlations. 

## Pre-lab activities {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities}

### Pre-lab activity 1 {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities-1}

In weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.

Completing the project involves collecting responses from *PSYC122* students: **you**.

To enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.

Complete the survey by clicking on the link [here]()

::: callout-tip
In our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.
:::

The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.

Taking part in the survey is **completely voluntary**.
You can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it.
If you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).

All responses will be recorded completely anonymously.

### Pre-lab activity alternative option {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities-2}

If you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.

[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)

## Lab activities {#sec-wk6-lab-activities}

### Introduction {#sec-wk6-lab-activities-1-introduction}

We will do our practical lab work to develop your skills in the context of the **Clearly understood** project.

- Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information.

**Why are we doing this?**
We encounter written health information all the time: in warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about.
It is not always easy to understand this information.
The problem is that it is unclear how health information should be communicated.
As psychologists, we can help to improve health communication.

::: callout-important
In these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions:

1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?
2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?
:::

### Get ready {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities-ready}

**Download the data** [122_week16_for_students.zip](data/week16/122_week16_for_students.zip) files folder and upload the contents to the new folder you created in RStudio Server.

The folder includes the data files:

- `study-one-general-participants.csv`
- `study-two-general-participants.csv`

and the R Markdown `.Rmd`:

- `2023-24-PSYC122-w16-how-to.Rmd`

## Answers {#sec-wk6-lab-activities-answers}

When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. **Remember**, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. **Actively engaging** with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else's completed code...

## Online Q&A {#sec-wk6-lab-Q-and-A}
