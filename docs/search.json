What is new, here, is that we will explore the power and flexibility of the linear model analysis method in two important aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWe will fit linear models including multiple predictors, this is why this form of analysis is also often called multiple regression. 2 We will use linear models to estimate the effects of numeric and categorical or nominal predictor variables.\n\n\n\nWhen we do these analyses, we will need to adapt how we report the results:\n\nwe need to report information about the model we specify, identifying all predictors;\nwe will need to decide if the effects of one or more predictors are significant;\nwe will report the model fit statistics (F, R-squared) as well as coefficient estimates;\nand we need to learn to write texts describing the impact of predictors.\n\nUsually, in describing the impacts of predictors, we are required to communicate:\n\nthe direction of the effect – do values of the outcome variable increase or decrease given increasing values of the predictor?\nthe size of the effect – how much do values of the outcome variable increase or decrease given increasing values of the predictor?\n\nThis task of description is enabled by producing plots of the predictions we can make:\n\nabout how we expect the outcome to change, given different values of a predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe will aim to build skills in producing professional-looking plots for our audiences.\n\nWe can produce plots showing the effects of predictors\nAs predictions of change in outcome, given different values of the predictor variables."

Working with the linear model with multiple predictors\nWe focus in-depth on how you code linear models, how you identify critical information in the results summaries, and how you report the results: the language and the style you can use in your reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nA small change to lm() coding releases power and flexibility in how you use the analysis method.\n\n\n\n2. Analyses are done in context so when we conduct analyses we must use contextual information\nThe power and flexibility of the linear model presents challenges. We must decide which predictor variables we specify in our model. This specification requires us to think about our theoretical assumptions and what they require us to include to make sense of the behaviours or the individual differences we observe when we do things like investigating what makes health information easy or difficult to understand.\n3. Developing critical thinking\nAs we develop conceptual understanding and practical skills, we must learn to reflect critically on our analyses, and learn to critically evaluate the analyses we read about when we read research reports in the scientific literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCritical analysis can develop by considering\n\nvalidity\nmeasurement\ngeneralizability\n\n\n\nWe are always working in the broader context of uncertainty:\n\nuncertainty about the predictions we may make concerning outcomes of interest;\nuncertainty given the possibility that predicted effects may vary between individuals or groups;\nuncertainty given the influence of sources of randomness in how specific responses are produced.\n\n\nLinks to other classes\nIn the lecture, I sketch out the ways that the linear model can be extended. You will learn new and different analysis methods in the second year classes but, most of the time, you may understand that …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEverything is some kind of linear model."

Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Visualising the regression line\nHave a look at this visualisation of the regression line by Ryan Safner.\nIn this shiny app, you see a randomly-generated set of data points (within specific parameters, to keep the graph scaled properly). You can choose a slope and intercept for the regression line by using the sliders. The graph also displays the residuals as dashed red lines. Moving the slope or the intercept too much causes the generated line to create much larger residuals. The shiny app also calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the standard error of the regression (SER), which calculates the average size of the error (the red numbers). These numbers reflect how well the regression line fits the data, but you don’t need to worry about those for now.\nIn the app he uses the equation Y = aX + b in which b is the intercept and a is the slope.\nThis is slightly different from the equation you saw during the lecture. There we talked about Y = b0 + b1*X + e. Same equation, just different letters. So b0 in the lecture is equivalent to b in the app and b1 in the lecture is equivalent to a in the app.\nPre-lab activity questions:\n\nChange the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line?\nChange the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line?\nWhat happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line?\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Data visualisation - practice with ggplot2()\nIn this week’s online tutorials, you will practise visualing data.\nIf you’re ready to begin, go to the tutorial linked to below.

The distance between the fitted values (the line) and the observed values (the dots) increases. Therefore, the red dashed lines become longer suggesting that the residuals increase. The model therefore fits the data less well.\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 2: Statistics anxiety and engagement in module activities\nIn this lab, we’ll be working with real data and using regression to explore the question of whether there is a relationship between statistics anxiety and engagement in course activities. You’ll need the data files psess.csv and stars2.csv and the R-script 122_wk13_labAct2_template.R that you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 3.\n\nBackground\nThe hypothesis is that students who are more anxious about statistics are less likely to engage in course-related activities. This avoidance behaviour could ultimately be responsible for lower performance for these students (although we won’t be examining the assessment scores in this activity).\nWe are going to analyse data from the STARS Statistics Anxiety Survey, which was administered to students in the third-year statistics course in Psychology at the University of Glasgow. All the responses have been anonymised by associating the responses for each student with an arbitrary ID number (integer).\nThe STARS survey (Cruise, Cash, & Bolton, 1985) is a 51-item questionnaire, with each response on a 1 to 5 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater anxiety.\nCruise, R. J., Cash, R. W., & Bolton, D. L. (1985). Development and validation of an instrument to measure statistical anxiety. Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, Section on Statistical Education, Las Vegas, NV.\nExample items from the STARS survey\n\nAs a measure of engagement in the course, we will use data from Moodle usage analytics. Over the course of the term, there were eight optional weekly on-line sessions that students could attend for extra support. The variable n_weeks in the psess.csv file tells you how many (out of eight) a given student attended.\nOur hypothesis was that greater anxiety would be reflected in lower engagement. Answer the following question.\nQUESTION 1: If our hypothesis is correct, what type of correlation (if any) should we observe between students’ mean anxiety levels and the variable n_weeks?\nBefore we do anything else, let’s load the libraries that we need for this analysis.\n\nTASK: Load broom, car and tidyverse. HINT: Use library().\n\n\nTASK: Read in both files, have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it. HINTYou can use the read_csv() and the head() function.\n\nQUESTION 2 In the stars table, what do the numbers in the first row across the three columns refer to?\nNow that we’ve read in both data files, the next step is to calculate the mean anxiety scores for each participant. At the moment we have scores on all questions separately for each participant in the stars table. Instead we need one mean anxiety score for each participant.\n\nTASK: Write the code to calculate mean anxiety scores. Remember that participant is identified by the ID variable. Store the resulting table in a variable named stars_mean. HINT: Use group_by() and summarise(). Also, remember to use na.rm = TRUE when calculating the mean scores to deal with participants who have missing data (NAs).\n\nQUESTION 3 What is the mean anxiety score for participant 3?\nOk, before we get ahead of ourselves, in order to perform the regression analysis we need to combine the data from stars (the mean anxiety scores) with the data from engage (n_weeks).\n\nTASK: Join the two tables, call the resulting table joined. HINT: Use the inner_join() function (making use of the variable that is common across both tables) to join.\n\nWe now need descriptive statistics for both variables.\n\nTASK: Calculate the mean and standard deviations for the anxiety scores and the engagement data.\n\nQUESTION 4 What are the means and standard deviation for anxiety and engagement with the statistics module?\nAs always, it is a good idea to visualise your data.Now that we have all the variables in one place, make a scatterplot of anxiety as a function of engagement.\n\nTASK: Write the code to create the scatterplot. HINT: For this you’ll need the ggplot() function together with geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels with the labs() function.\n\nQUESTION 5 What does the scatterplot suggest about the relationship between anxiety and engagement?\nWith all the variables in place, we’re ready now to start building the regression model.\n\nTASK: Use the lm() function to run the regression model when you model engagement (the outcome variable) as a function of anxiety (the predictor variable) and use the summary() function to look at the output. HINT: lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = my_data).\n\nQUESTION 6 What is the estimate of the y-intercept for the model, rounded to three decimal places?\nQUESTION 7 To three decimal places, if the General Linear Model for this model is Y=beta0 + beta1X + e, then beta1 is …\nQUESTION 8 To three decimal places, for each unit increase in anxiety, engagement decreases by …\nQUESTION 9 To two decimal places, what is the overall F-ratio of the model?\nQUESTION 10 Is the overall model significant?\nQUESTION 11 What proportion of the variance does the model explain?\nNow that we’ve fitted a model, let’s check whether the model meets the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity.\n\nTASK: Write the code to check the assumptions. HINT: crPlots() to check linearity, qqPlot() to check normality of the residuals, and residualPlot() to check homoscedasticity of the residuals.\n\nQUESTION 12 Does the relationship appear to be linear?\nQUESTION 13 Do the residuals show normality?\nQUESTION 14 Do the residuals show homoscedasticity?\nFinally, it’s time to write up the results following APA guidelines.\nQUESTION 15 What would the results section look like if you wrote them up, following APA guidelines? HINT: The Purdue writing lab website is helpful for guidance on punctuating statistics."

Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Visualing correlations\nHave a look at this visualisation of correlations by Kristoffer Magnusson.\nAfter having read the relevant sections of Howell (2017) Chapter 9, use this visualisation page to visually replicate the scatterplots in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 - use a sample of 100. After that, visually replicate the scatterplots in Figure 9.3.\nEach time you change the correlation, pay attention to the shared variance (the overlap between the two variables) and see how this changes with the changing level of relationship between the two variables. The greater the shared variance, the stronger the relationship.\nAlso, try setting the correlation to r = .5 and then moving a single dot to see how one data point, a potential outlier, can change the stated correlation value between two variables.\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Guess the correlation\nNow that you are well versed in interpreting scatterplots (scattergrams) have a go at this online app on guessing the correlation.\nThis is a very basic app that allows you to see how good you are at recognising different correlation strengths from the scatterplots. We would recommend you click the “Track Performance” tab so you can keep an overview of your overall bias to underestimate or overestimate a correlation.\nIs this all just a bit of fun? Well, yes, because stats is actually fun, and no, because it serves a purpose of helping you determine if the correlations you see in your own data are real, and to help you see if correlations in published research match with what you are being told. As you will have seen from the above examples, one data point can lead to a misleading relationship and even what might be considered a medium to strong relationship may actually have only limited relevance in the real world. One only needs to mention Anscombe’s Quartet to be reminded of the importance of visualising your data, which leads us to the final pre-lab activity for this week.\n\n\nPre-lab activity 3: Anscombe’s quartet\nAnscombe (1973) showed that four sets of bivariate data (X, Y) that have the exact same means, medians, and relationships can look very different when plotted. You can read more about this here.\nAll in this is a clear example of why you should visualise your data and not to rely on just the numbers.\n\n\nPre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nRemind yourself of the basics of how to work with RStudio.\nYou might want to re-visit some of the materials that John and Tom provided in PSYC121:\n\nBasics of working with RStudio\nVideo on how to upload a zip file and import data (3.5 mins)\nVideo on basic operations in RStudio (8 mins)\nVideo on using scripts and using the console (3 mins)\n\n\n\nCreate a folder and a Project for Week 11.\nClick here for the instructions from Week 6 of PSYC121 if you are unsure.\n\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 122_week11_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created at the previous step.

    "text": "Lab activities\nIn this lab, you’ll gain understanding of and practice with:\n\nconstructing and interpreting scatterplots\nrunning correlation analysis and interpret the results\nreporting the results in APA format\nconstructing a correlation matrix in APA format\nwhen and why to apply correlation analysis to answers questions in psychological science\n\n\nLab activity 1: Interpreting correlation\n\nQuestion 1\nBelow are scatterplots that show the relationship between ‘how much you know about correlation and how attractive you appear to members of the opposite (&/or same) sex’. Choose the type of correlation (strength and direction) displayed in each graph using one of the following:\n\nPerfect positive correlation\nPerfect negative correlation\nStrong positive correlation\nStrong negative correlation\nModerate positive correlation\nModerate negative correlation\nNull correlation\n\nFigure A \nFigure B \nFigure C \nFigure D \n\n\nQuestion 2\nSuppose it was observed that there is a correlation of r = -.81 between a driver’s age and the cost of car insurance. This correlation would mean that, in general, older people pay more for car insurance.\nTRUE or FALSE? Explain why.\nNote: explain your chosen answer based on the statistic given, not on why you think the correlation may or may note make ‘logical’ sense).\n\n\nQuestion 3\nSuppose that there is a correlation of r = .87 between the length of time a person is in prison and the amount of aggression the person displays on a psychological inventory administered at release. This means that spending a longer amount of time in prison causes people to become more aggressive.\nTRUE or FALSE? Explain why.\n\n\nQuestion 4\nA significant correlation was found between having great hair and performance in correlation labs. The correlation coefficient was .7. How much variance in correlation lab performance can the ‘greatness’ of your hair explain?\n\n51%\n70%\n49%\n30%\nWho cares I’ve got great hair.\n\nWhat was the reason for your answer?\nWhat is this ‘new coefficient’ called?\n\n\n\nLab activity 2: Visualising, calculating and reporting correlations\nGoing back to the data discussed in Chapter 11 of Miller & Haden, you’ll remember it contains data from 25 8-year-old children on:\n\na standardised test of reading ability (Abil)\nintelligence (IQ)\nthe number of minutes per week spent reading in the home (Home)\nand the number of minutes per week spent watching TV (TV)\n\nIn the video on ‘How to conduct correlation analysis using R’ we looked at the correlation between reading ability and intelligence. Now, let’s look at the correlation between number of minutes per week spent reading in the home and watching TV.\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the datafile (“MillerHadenData.csv”) as well as the R-script from the ‘How to …’ video (122_wk11_howtoExample.R) that you can use here and adapt.\n\nLoad the ‘broom’ and the ‘tidyverse’ libraries by running the first two lines of code.\nRead in the data. You should now see an object with 25 observations and 5 variables in the ‘Environment’. Click on it to view it.\nConstruct a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘Home’ and ‘TV’.\nWhat can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship?\nConduct the correlation analysis.\nWhat is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)?\nWhat is the p value?\nIs the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level?\nWhat are the degrees of freedom you need to report?\nHow much variance in ‘time spent reading’ can be accounted for by ‘time spent watching TV’? (Hint: you can use the Console in RStudio as a calculator.)\nWrite a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines.\n\n\n\nLab activity 3: More correlations\nResearchers were interested in the relationship between hazardous alcohol use and impulsivity (making unplanned, rapid decisions without thinking or ‘acting on a whim’). To investigate the relationship, 20 participants completed both the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1993) and the Barratt’s Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995). The datafile (“alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv”) is in the folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’. Again, the R-script from the ‘How to …’ video (122_wk11_howtoExample.R) is useful here.\n\nLoad the ‘broom’ and the ‘tidyverse’ libraries by running the first two lines of code.\nRead in the data. You should now see an object containing the data in the ‘Environment’. How many variables does it have?\nConstruct a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘Hazardous Alcohol Use’ and ‘Impulsivity’.\nWhat can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship?\nConduct the correlation analysis.\nWhat is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)?\nWhat is the p value?\nIs the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level?\nWhat are the degrees of freedom you need to report?\nHow much variance in ‘impulsivity’ can be accounted for by ‘hazardous alcohol use’? (Hint: you can use the Console in RStudio as a calculator.)\nConstruct a correlation matrix to display the correlation coefficient in a table.\nGive three logically possible directions of causality, indicating for each direction whether it is a plausible explanation in light of the variables involved (and why). No, this is not a trick question —-I know that correlation does not infer causation, but think critically! New studies/ideas are constructed by thinking what the previous study doesn’t tell us about what could be happening with the variables of interest.\n\nJob completed — Well done!"

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\n\nLab activity 1: Interpreting correlation\n\nScatterplots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrong positive correlation\nnull correlation\nmoderate positive correlation\nperfect negative correlation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFALSE Explanation: The correlation coefficient is negative and therefore infers a negative correlation. As such, older people pay less for car insurance: as age increases, car insurance costs decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFALSE Explanation: This is a bit of trick question as it has the sneaky ‘cause’ word in. The correlation coefficient is a positive number, suggesting a positive relationship between length of time in prison and aggression. However, causation cannot be inferred from correlation and therefore we cannot know whether time spent in prison CAUSES aggression, and rather we suggest a relationship between the two that as length of time in prison increases, aggression increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nc 49% The ‘coefficient of determination’ or ‘R-squared’ tells us the proportion or variance in one variable that can be predicted if we know the other variable. We can determine this by squaring the r. Therefore, .72 = .49, R2 = .49.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 2: Constructing scatterplots and calculating correlations\nYou can download the R-script that contains the code to complete lab activities 2 and 3 here: 122_wk11_labActivities2_3.R.\n\nSee R script\nSee R script\nSee R script\nWhat can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a negative association between ‘Home’ and ‘TV’.

There was a significant negative correlation, r(23) = -.65, p &lt; .001. As time spent watching TV at home increased, time spent reading at home decreased.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 3: More correlations\n\nSee R script\nHow many variables does it have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nSee R script\nWhat can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a positive association between ‘hazardous alcohol use’ and ‘impulsivity’.

    "section": "Task 3 - Using RStudio",
    "text": "Task 3 - Using RStudio\n\nIntroducing R Studio\nR and RStudio is the software that we will be using to explore and learn about analysis in your Psychology degree. It’s a computational engine: a very snazzy calculator that you should see as your friend and ally in the journey to understand and appreciate psychology. It sits alongside what we teach about the concepts and interpretation of statistical analysis.\nR is the core software, RStudio is the interface for interacting with it. Put another way, R is the engine, RStudio is the cockpit.\nLike even a simplest calculator, it just does what you ask (at least when you ask nicely!) but it requires the user to know what they want from it and to understand what it is telling you. A calculator can’t help a kid get the right answer to a multiplication problem if they don’t know the difference between multiplication and division and addition etc. And whilst a calculator is brilliant at doing the number crunching (and as a bonus, R Studio can help with turning the numbers into beautiful graphs and images too), even a calculator requires a thoughtful person to take the answers and make sensible interpretations from them.\nTherefore, we need to learn both about the concepts of statistical analysis on the one hand, and the processing of statistical information -through R- on the other. The lectures will provide the starting point and the direction for statistical concepts, whilst these analysis labs provide the more practical experiences in how to use R, and how to make R your ally. Over the next year, in these labs we will increasingly be using RStudio to focus on the latter, processing side, which will allow you to focus your energies on the conceptual side and its relevance for appreciating psychology.\n\n\nGetting started with RStudio\nFor Lancaster University Psychology Students in 2023, we will be learning about R Studio through a simple but powerful web server architecture. That is, through the power of the internet, you can access and use R Studio by logging into a free account that we have provided and we will maintain for your use.\n\nHere’s a little secret: There are several different ways to access RStudio. For example, you can download a copy of the software onto your computer, or use a Virtual Machine set up to run a copy. There’s nothing to stop you having your local copy, but please note - we can’t support your own version through lab classes. We’re using the web server to make sure everyone has the same, controlled experience.\n\nTo log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS instructions here or connecting to Eduroam here.\nWhen you are connected, navigate to https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk, where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says “Sign in with SAML”.\n \nThis will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have already logged in through the university login already, perhaps to get to the portal, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does RStudio look like?\nWhen RStudio starts, it will look something like this: \nRStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right) , Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side).\n\n\nLet’s get started!\nThe first thing we want to do in RStudio is to create a folder for this week so that we can put the relevant material there and keep it tidy.\nFrom the lower-right panel of RStudio, click the files tab.\nSelect the “new folder” option and create a new folder (eg “week 1”)\nClick on that folder to open it\nNext, we’ve prepared some instructions for RStudio to use - this is called a “script”. So we need to get this script into the server for you to explore and play with\n\nDownload the “zip” file by clicking this link\nFind the location of the file on your computer and check it is saved as a “.zip” file\nReturn to RStudio\nClick “Upload”\nClick choose file and find the file on your computer.\nSelect the file and click “Open”. Click “OK”\n\nYou should now see the files extracted in the directory.\nYou should now have the script available in RStudio.\nUse “Save…As” to create a new version of the script. By doing this, you’ll be able to have a “before” and “after” version of the script and can go back over the changes\nIn the script, select or highlight the first line of text, which is this one:\n\nRun your first ever R instruction!\n\n5 + 5\n\nand “run” this line. That tells RStudio to carry out the instruction.\nYou should see that in the console tab, RStudio calculates the answer to this incredibly hard maths challenge! (amazing huh? OK, maybe not *that* amazing…).\n\n\nModify your first ever R instruction!\nUse your imagination – add a new line to the script and ask a different simple arithmetic question of your own choosing! What happens?\n\n\nCalculate descriptive stats in R for the first time!\nIn this week’s analysis lecture, we looked at measures of central tendency and how to calculate them. So let’s get R to do these calculations also!\nFirst, we tell R about the data used in the lecture. We’ve already created the instruction that will do exactly this and it is in the script, so run this line from the script\n\nweek_1_lecture_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8)\n\nThis creates an “object” called week_1_lecture_data. We can then perform calculations on this object. For example, we can find the mean by running the following command (use the script to do this)\n\nmean(week_1_lecture_data)\n\nCheck the answer is the same we found in the lecture (it should be 6!).\nNext, let’s ask for the median by running this line from the script:\n\nmedian(week_1_lecture_data)\n\nThis also should be the answer from the lecture (7)\nR doesn’t have a single corresponding command for the mode, but we can use the block of code in the script for this that starts and ends with the “getmode” text (there are 6 lines of text)\nThis is just a bit of clever jiggery-pokery that gets the mode. What does R say the mode is?\n\n\nYour challenge\nHow can you get RStudio to verify / check the dice calculations that you attempted earlier? Think about how you might solve this problem, on the basis of what we have covered so far.\nWe will discuss this in class and attempt to get RStudio to check your answers. In doing so, annotate the script (add notes for you - not RStudio) using the “#” command"

It’s a good habit to get into to turn the session off\n\n\nExtra content for outside the lab class\n\nIn the Howell text book on statistics, there’s some R code on descriptive statistics. It is included in the script for you to look at and play with.\nin your own time and think about the following:\n\nIn R, “&lt;-” is the assignment operator as in the command we used:\n\nPSYC121_week_1_data &lt;- c(7,8,8,7,3,1,6,9,3,8)\n\nWe create the variable label on the left (Analysis_week1_data) and we give it those numbers on the right. The nameAnalysis_week1_data is largely arbitrary: try use a variable of your own naming (your own name?) instead - and then use that alternative name for the other commands.\n\nThroughout this year, we’ll use the convention of the “underscore” to separate words in labels (it_makes_them_easier_to_read than ifyoudidn’thaveanyspaces)"

By using a common data set, that we can return to over the year, we can also build up familiarity and confidence in the data and remove a potential obstacle to thinking about the more important analysis part.\nSo a key task will be for everyone to have a go at taking our online survey, and contribute to a dataset that can be used throughout the year.\nThe survey runs from here by following this link"

If others are experiencing issues, get in touch with your module coordinator to get this looked at.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        My code doesn't work and keeps giving me errors. How do I fix this?\n      \n    \n    \n      Welcome to statistical programming. Try and carefully read the error codes to understand what the problem may be. You might be surprised to find out that the internet is an amazing resource for fixing your errors. Once you’ve checked it isn’t a typo, you can often copy-paste the error message into Google to see if others are having similar issues. Trusted resources include Stackoverflow, r-bloggers. The important thing is not to be afraid of errors, they’re trying to be helpful!\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Is the server down?\n      \n    \n    \n      Hopefully not, but maybe. If it is, then the error is likely a \"connection refused\" and may even say something about the server maybe being down. If this is the case, either wait a little while to see if we’re in the middle of booting it back up, or get in touch with your module coordinator to pass the message on to the R team.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        Is there another way to use Rstudio without the R server?\n      \n    \n    \n      Yes! \n      You can also install R and Rstudio onto your own computer which has its advantages and disadvantages to using the R server. You can install R and Rstudio directly from Posit (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), who develop and maintain Rstudio. You will need to install both, R is the programming language and Rstudio is the interface between you and the computer that runs R. The advantage of having your own installation of R and Rstudio (just referred to as Rstudio from here on in) is that *you* control the settings completely. \n\n\n\nYou can install new packages, set defaults, use specific versions of R and its libraries. In short, you have complete control over what you can do, which will lead to you becoming a better, more well-rounded data scientist (when we use R, we are data scientists as well as psychologists. You can wear many hats of expertise!). The disadvantage is that *you* are in control. If something goes wrong or doesn't install properly, it is up to you to resolve. As a department, we strongly recommend that you use the R server as your means of accessing Rstudio as we know that the server works, we have tested the teaching materials with the server and in labs we can help troubleshoot because we know that the version of R, the libraries, etc. are handled by us, we look after it so that you don't have to. A multitude of things can go wrong with a personal installation and you will need to fix this (which is part of being a well-rounded data scientist). If you ask for help with a local install, the first thing we will ask is \"does it work on the R server?\", if the answer is yes, then we can give some pointers but we cannot fix it for you (in my personal experience, I once spent 8+ hours of actively trying to fix a single issue with my Rstudio \\[okay, so it was quite complex an issue, but the point remains\\]). As you see, the advantage and disadvantage are intrinsically linked. \n\n\n\nFrom a teaching perspective, we cannot try and problem solve every person's individual and unique setup of Rstudio, there simply isn't enough time in a week. Yet the benefit of having your own version means you are totally unrestricted in what you can do with R, if you can imagine it, there is probably a set of libraries and functions that can help. If there isn't, you can make them! It is your choice for how to use Rstudio, but we recommend that you use the R server for the materials that we teach, but we provide this to complement and enhance the teaching experience. If you want to go beyond what is in the worksheets, then installing and using your own version of Rstudio is a very good first step\n    \n  \n  \n      \n    \n      \n        Where can I learn more about R and Rstudio outside of the labs?\n      \n    \n    \n      Great question. We can recommend looking at these books, R for Data Science, Advanced R, etc., as well as websites like StackOverflow, r-bloggers. Quite often, googling terms like \"r linear regression\" or \"r residuals for regression\" will help you find someone who has a tutorial and code to look at. Don’t be afraid to explore and adapt other people’s examples to work for you.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the PSYC121 lab material for 2023!\nIn this module you will learn the basics of data handling, data processing and data visualisation. What that means is that, by the end of the this module (at Christmas time), you will be able to take a set of data, look at some basic statistics (e.g., the mean value), filter and process the data in order to answer basic questions about it, and present the data in an appealing way with different graphs. On top of this, you will be able to apply some of your knowledge of the basic “inferential” statistical tests that we will introduce in the lecture series (e.g., “t-test”).\nIn Week 1 we will introduce you to the software that we use to do all this useful work in statistics: “R” and “RStudio”. This is a coding language, and you will be taught the basics of how to write code in order to do all of the above key steps in data analysis. This tuition will continue in Term 2, and in your statistics modules in Year 2. Coding is challenging, but we know from experience that those students who attend classes, who work through the exercises carefully, and who seek help when they need it, do very well on these modules.\nMost of all, it’s important that you recognise that data analysis (statistics) is a critical aspect of the study of psychology. When we want to understand behaviour, we take measurements of that behaviour, which the majority of the time will result in quantitative (numerical) data. In order to understand the behaviour in a meaningful way, we need to conduct all of the above steps in our data analysis workflow. In summary, we cannot investigate psychological processes without the skills and toolbox of statistics and data analysis techniques.\n\n\nWorking at your own pace and seeking help\nWe have carefully prepared and refined the lab materials in this course over several years, and we feel that the pace of the materials is just right for our students. Some students will complete them more quickly, and others more slowly - both of these scenarios are absolutely fine. You should work at the pace that suits you best, making sure you understand the materials before you move forward.\nIt is fairly inevitable that you will get stuck on the lab materials in this module at some point. This might be in Week 1, Week 2, or later. When you do, it’s important you reach out for help:\n\nAsk your friends on your table. We’ve designed this teaching space to help collaborative work. You are encouraged to work with other students. Make sure you ask others to explain how they’ve solved an exercise. Make sure you help out others where you can. Always make sure you understand the code and the exercise; don’t simply be satisfied that you’ve got the right answer.\nAsk a GTA or Lecturer. Our Graduate Teaching Assistants are there to help you. There are no “stupid questions” in statistics, so just ask the GTAs any question about what you’re doing. Likewise, ask the Lecturer.\nAsk on the Discussion Forum. On the PSYC121 moodle page you will find a Discussion Forum. This is a great way to ask a question outside of the lab sessions. It might seem scary to ask a question in the forum, but please don’t be afraid to do this. If you have a question, you can bet 30+ other students also have the same question! So by asking the question on the forum, you help out many more people on the module. A friendly GTA or Lecturer will be along to answer the question as soon as possible (we aim for within 48 hours during the working week).\nAsk on the module Q & A session. Each week we hold a “Q&A” online session where we will try and resolve any general queries and problems. It’s an ideal time to discuss things that students are struggling with or confused about, and can share ideas and answers. You can ask on the discussion forum above and then we might be able to pick up the issues and discuss them, but also you can ask in the session itself.\n\nAsking good questions - it’s really important that you give us as much information as you can when you ask your questions (in class and especially on the forum). It’s so much harder to help respond to “I can’t do Exercise 5 in Week 7” (because we don’t know why it is that you can’t do it) than for example “In Exercise 5 of Week 7, I’ve managed to read in the data, put the graph looks quite odd. Here is the code I’m using…”\n\n\nCourse Contacts\nIf you have something that needs to be private, then please feel free to email the academic staff at the email addresses below:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nTom Beesley (Coordinator)\nt.beesley at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\nJohn Towse\nj.towse at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

We know that some of you are new to R so we will practice the skills you are learning. We will consolidate, revise, and extend these skills.\nWe will build your understanding of the linear model.\nThe big change is this focus on the context. The reason is that not talking about the context risks limiting how you approach, do or think about data analysis.\nIn traditional methods teaching, the schedule of classes will progress through a series of tests, one test a week, from simpler to more complex tests (e.g., from t-test to multiple regression at the undergraduate level). Textbooks often mirror this structure, presenting one test per chapter.\nIn this approach, the presentation is often brief about the context: the question the researchers are investigating; the methods they use to collect data, including the measurements; and the assumptions they make about how your reasoning can get you from the things you measure to the things you are trying to understand. In this approach, also, example data may be presented in a limited, partial, way.\nThe reasons for this are understandable: methods are complex, technical, subjects for learning, and teachers and students do not also have time, perhaps, to think about statistics and about theoretical or measurement assumptions.\nThis is risky because it presents a misleading view of the challenge in learning methods: the misleading view is that the challenge is just the (difficult enough) challenge of learning about statistical methods, or dealing with numbers. It is risky, also, because it implies that if you learn the method, and can match the textbook example – the variables, the state of the data – when it is your turn to do an analysis, all will be well.\nA more productive approach – this is the approach we will take – is to expose, and talk about some of the real challenges that anybody who handles data, or quantitative evidence, in professional life. These challenges include:\n\nThinking about the mapping from our concerns to the research questions, to the things we measure, to analysis we do, and then the conclusions we make.\nSelecting or constructing valid measures that can be assumed to measure the things they are supposed to measure.\nTaking samples of observations, and making conclusions about the population.\nMaking estimates and linking these estimates to an account that is explicit about causes."

Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Online interactive tutorial to practise your data-wrangling skills\nData comes in lots of different formats. One of the most common formats is that of a two-dimensional table (the two dimensions being rows and columns). Usually, each row stands for a separate observation (e.g. a participant), and each column stands for a different variable (e.g. a response, category, or group). A key benefit of tabular data is that it allows you to store different types of data-numerical measurements, alphanumeric labels, categorical descriptors-all in one place.\nIt may surprise you to learn that scientists actually spend far more of time cleaning and preparing their data than they spend actually analysing it. This means completing tasks such as cleaning up bad values, changing the structure of tables, merging information stored in separate tables, reducing the data down to a subset of observations, and producing data summaries. Some have estimated that up to 80% of time spent on data analysis involves such data preparation tasks (Dasu & Johnson, 2003)!\nMany people seem to operate under the assumption that the only option for data cleaning is the painstaking and time-consuming cutting and pasting of data within a spreadsheet program like Excel. We have witnessed students and colleagues waste days, weeks, and even months manually transforming their data in Excel, cutting, copying, and pasting data. Fixing up your data by hand is not only a terrible use of your time, but it is error-prone and not reproducible. Additionally, in this age where we can easily collect massive datasets online, you will not be able to organise, clean, and prepare these by hand.\nIn short, you will not thrive as a psychologist if you do not learn some key data wrangling skills. Although every dataset presents unique challenges, there are some systematic principles you should follow that will make your analyses easier, less error-prone, more efficient, and more reproducible.\nIn the online tutorial, you will see how data science skills will allow you to efficiently get answers to nearly any question you might want to ask about your data. By learning how to properly make your computer do the hard and boring work for you, you can focus on the bigger issues.\nYou’ll be practising the select(), filter(), mutate(), arrange(), group_by() and summarise() functions from the dplyr package.\nYou’ve used these functions before, but if you’d like to quickly remind yourself what they do, watch the video (~10 min) on Data wrangling: dplyr and pipes. As the title suggests, I also explain in the video what a ‘pipe’ (this thing: %&gt;%) is and you’ll be practising with that as well.\nIf you’re ready to begin, go to the tutorial linked to below. There is no need to install or download anything. Each tutorial has everything you need to write and run R code, right in the tutorial.\n\nWorking with Tibbles Practise how to extract values form a table, subset tables, calculate summary statistics, and derive new variables.\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 122_week12_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created (see last week’s Pre-lab activity 4 for instructions on how to do that."

Now we really want to see what you can do yourself. In this activity we’ll use real data on implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping. You’ll need the data file VapingData.csv and the R-script 122_wk12_labAct2_template.R that you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 2.\n\nBackground\nExplicit attitudes were measured via a questionnaire where higher scores indicated a positive attitude towards vaping (VapingQuestionaireScore). Implicit attitudes were measured through an Implicit Association Test (IAT) using images of Vaping and Kitchen utensils and associating them with positive and negative words.\nThe IAT works on the principal that associations that go together (that are congruent, e.g. warm and sun) should be quicker to respond to than associations that do not go together (that are incongruent, e.g. warm and ice). You can read up more on the procedure on the Noba Project which has a good description of the procedure under the section “Subtle/Nonsconscious Research Methods”.\nFor this exercise, you need to know that “Block 3” in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards congruent associations, pairing positive words with Kitchen utensils and negative words with Vaping. “Block 5” in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards incongruent associations, pairing positive words with Vaping and negative words with Kitchen Utensils. As such, if reaction times were longer in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is negative (i.e. congruent associations are quicker than incongruent associations). However, if reaction times were quicker in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is positive (i.e. incongruent associations were quicker than congruent associations). The difference between reaction times in Block5 and Block3 is called the participants’ IAT score.\n\n\nStep 0: Clean your environment\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. You can do this by clicking on the broom icon at the top of the environment window, or you can use the code below.\n\nTASK: Use the code snippet below to clear the environment. TIP: If you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a ‘copy to clipboard’ icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script. \n\n\nrm(list=ls())                            \n\n\n\nStep 1: Set your working directory\nNow, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data file (VapingData.csv).\n\nTASK: Use the code snippet below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the ‘Files’ pane on the right. Does it contain the data file (‘VapingData.csv’)?\n\n\ngetwd()\n\nIf your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the ‘Files’ pane, click ‘More’ and then on ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Load packages\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom, car, Hmisc, lsr and tidyverse.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. HINT: Use the library() function.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Read in the data\nThe data file we’ll be working with is VapingData.csv\n\nTASK: Read in the data file (using the read_csv() function) and store it in an object called dat. Have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it. You have 8 columns. Reaction times and Accuracy scores for Blocks 3 and 5 as well as the Explicit Vaping Questionnaire scores, Sex and Age, for each participant.\n\nQUESTION 1: For how many participants do we have data?\n\n\nStep 4: Data wrangling\nThe data are not in a shape yet that we can actually use for our analysis. We’ll have to do some ’data wrangling to knock them into shape. We need to take the following into account:\n\nAccuracy was calculated as proportion and as such can’t go above 1.Participants entered their own data so some might have made a mistake. Remove participants who had an accuracy greater than 1 in either Block 3 or Block 5 as we are unclear on the accuracy of these values.\nWe also only want participants who were paying attention so best remove anybody whose average accuracy score across Blocks 3 and 5 was less than 80%. Note - this value is arbitrary and if you wanted, in your own experiment, you could use a more relaxed or strict cut-off based on other studies or guidance. Note that these decisions should be set out at the start of your research as part of your pre-registration or as part of your Registered Report. Finally, in this instance, remember, the values are in proportions not percentages (so 80% will be .8).\nNow that we have removed data points that were the result of data entry mistakes or came participants who didn’t pay attention during the task, we create an IAT score for participants by subtracting Block 3 reaction times (RT) from Block 5 reaction times (IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT).\n\n\nTASK: Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does.\n\n\ndat &lt;- dat %&gt;% \n  filter(IAT_BLOCK3_Acc &lt; 1) %&gt;%\n  filter(IAT_BLOCK5_Acc &lt; 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(IAT_ACC = (IAT_BLOCK3_Acc + IAT_BLOCK5_Acc)/2) %&gt;%\n  filter(IAT_ACC &gt; .8) %&gt;%\n  mutate(IAT_RT = IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT)\n\nQUESTION 2: For how many participants do we have data now that we have cleaned them up?\nQUESTION 3: Use the information in the background description to understand how the scores relate to attitudes. What does a positive IAT_RT score reflect? What does a negative IAT_RT score reflect? What does a higher score on the ‘VapingQuestionnaireScore’ mean?\n\n\nStep 5: Calculating descriptive statistics\nNow that we have the variables that we need and the data cleaned up, we will create a descriptives summary of the number of people, and the means for the IAT and Vaping Questionnaire Score.\n\nTASK: Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does.\n\n\ndescriptives &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean_IAT_ACC = mean(IAT_ACC),\n            mean_IAT_RT = mean(IAT_RT),\n            mean_VPQ = mean(VapingQuestionnaireScore, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nQUESTION 4: Why might these averages be useful? Why are averages not always useful in correlations?\n\n\nStep 6: Check the assumptions\nVariable types\nQUESTION 5: What are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables?\nMissing data\n\nTASK: Remove participants with missing data. HINT: Use the filter() function and the is.na() function\n\nQUESTION 6: How many people had missing data?\nNormality\n\nTASK: Create histograms and qq-plots for the IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore variables. HINT: Use the ggplot() function with geom_histogram() and use the qqPlot() function (note the capital P)\n\nQUESTION 7: What do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed?\nLinearity and homoscedasticity\n\nTASK: Plot the relationship between IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore using a scatterplot and a line of best fit. HINT: For this you’ll need the ggplot() function together with geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels.\n\nQUESTION 8: What do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship?

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\n\nLab activity 1\n\nCorrelation would be an appropriate form on analysis for researchers interested in the relationship between\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDog (breed) and height (cm) of owner\nSpeed of swimming (mph) and area of tank (cm)\nNumber of cows sitting and rain fall (mm)\nTotal llama saliva (ml) expelled and gender of visitors\nb and d\n\nf. b and c All variables in b anc c are continuous. Dog breed and gender are categorical.\n\n\n\n\nWhen would you use Spearman’s rho analysis instead of Pearson’s r?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. When the data is not normally distributed\n\n\n\n\nUsing the histograms and qq-plots below, which of these variables satisfies the normality assumption? Explain your answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nVocabulary. Only for vocabulary does the histogram resemble a bell curve and do the data-points in the qq-plot fall within the dashed blue lines.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should correlation analysis not be conducted on variables with a curvilinear relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMay be subject to a type 2 error - there actually is a relationship between variables yet we reject the null hypothesis. As the relationship is not linear, correlation analysis will not identify this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 2\nYou can download the R-script that contains the code to complete lab activity 2 here: 122_wk12_labAct2.R.\n\nFor how many participants do we have data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 166 observations, so we have data for 166 participants. You can see this in the Environment window in the top right. This does not tell us whether any of these participants have any missing data.\n\n\n\n\nFor how many participants do we have data now that we have cleaned them up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n104 participants\n\n\n\n\nUse the information in the background description to understand how the scores relate to attitudes. What does a positive IAT_RT score reflect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with a positive IAT_RT are considered to hold the implicit view that vaping is negative (i.e. congruent associations are quicker than incongruent associations)\n\n\n\nWhat does a negative IAT_RT score reflect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with a negative IAT_RT are considered to hold the implicit view that vaping is positive (i.e. incongruent associations were quicker than congruent associations). :::\nWhat does a higher score on the ‘VapingQuestionnaireScore’ mean?\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=“true”} ## Answer ::: Higher scores indicated a positive explicit attitude towards vaping. :::\n\nWhy might these averages be useful? Why are averages not always useful in correlations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is always worth thinking about which averages are informative and which are not. Knowing the average explicit attitude towards vaping could well be informative. In contrast, if you are using an ordinal scale and people use the whole of the scale then the average may just tell you the middle of the scale you are using - which you already know and really isn’t that informative. So it is always worth thinking about what your descriptives are calculating.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth can be considered continuous variables and at least at interval level.\n\n\n\n\nHow many people had missing data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Before we removed participants with missing data, we had 104 observations, now we have 96. So there must have been 8 participants without a score on one or the other variable.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Both histograms resemble a normal distribution (bell curve) and the open circles in the qq-plots fall within the blue stripy lines.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship? What does the scatterplot tell you about possible issues (outliers, range restrictions)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data look like a cloud without a clear direction. This suggests the relationship might might be weak. In terms of linearity, the scatterplot doesn’t suggest any curvilinear relationships. Variance seems quite constant, but there do seem to be few people with negative IAT_RT (Implicit attitude) scores, suggesting few people held the view that vaping is positive.\n\n\n\n\nDo you need to calculate Pearson’s r or Spearman’s rho?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPearson’s r because the data do meet the assumptions.\n\n\n\n\nCan you write up the results including the r, df, p-value and an interpretation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the hypothesis of a relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping, a Pearson correlation found no significant relationship between IAT reaction times (implicit attitude) and answers on a Vaping Questionnaire (explicit attitude), r(94) = -.02, p = .822. Overall this suggests that there is no direct relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes with regard to vaping and as such our hypothesis was not supported; we cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you conclude from the scatterplots?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplots with age suggest that age is highly skewed with only a few participants older than 25. For now, let’s say we’ll therefore calculate Spearman’s rho, rather than Pearson’s r. That is ok for now, but if you were analysing these data for a research project, you’d want to have a closer look at the age variable (think histogram, qq-plot, and think about either collecting more data from older participants or transforming the variable (more about that next year).\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you conclude from the results of the correlation analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNo significant correlation with age was found."

L. (2016). Reminders through association. Psychological Science, 27, 973-986. You can read the full paper online but the short version is that the authors looked at how people remember to follow through with the intention of doing something.\nAlthough there are lots of potential reasons (e.g., some people may lack the self-control resources), Rogers and Milkman (2016) propose that some people fail to follow through simply because they forget about their good intentions. If this is the case, the authors argue, then having visual reminders to follow through on their intentions may help people remember to keep them. For example, a person may choose to put a sticker for their gym on their car window, so that every time they get in the car they remember to go to the gym.\nIn Study 1 by Rogers and colleagues, participants took part in an unrelated experiment but at the start of the task they were asked to return a small stack of paper clips to the reception of the building at the end of the study and if they did so the researchers would donate $1 to a charity. They were then asked if they intended to do this. Those in the reminder-through-association (RTA) condition read “Thank you! To remind you to pick up a paper clip, an elephant statuette will be sitting on the counter as you collect your payment.” This message was followed by a picture of the elephant statuette. Those in the control condition simply read “Thank you!”.\nWhat we want to do is to run a chi-square analysis to determine whether those in the RTA condition were more likely to remember to return the paper-clips than those in the control condition. Open the 122_wk14_labAct2.R script in RStudio and work your way through it. All instructions, hints and questions are contained in the script."

    "text": "Lectures: video recordings\nThe lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part. (You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)\nPart 1 of 4; about 19 minutes\nPart 2 of 4; about 11 minutes\nPart 3 of 4; about 9 minutes\nPart 4 of 4; about 15 minutes\nThe lectures have two main areas of focus.\n1. Understanding the scientific process\nI outline the steps through which a psychological scientist may progress, in logic and practice, from research questions to hypotheses to analyses.\nI rehearse some of the key points I have discussed, previously, in order to build a framework in which you can understand how we go from:\n\na set of concerns – here: What makes it easy or difficult to understand written health information?\nthrough choices about what data to collect, and how\nto specific questions, and then predictions\nthat we can test using linear models.\n\nWe are learning data analysis methods. But the key point is that we use these methods in the context of a research project with concerns, aims, methodological assumptions, and choices. This is generally true so the aim is to present a concrete example of how research works.\nAs part of the discussion, I raise questions you might want to consider. These questions – and questions you can originate for yourselves – are also part of the context for our data analysis, because they help to inform how you interpret or evaluate the results. These questions are examples of the critical evaluation that you will need to develop through your studies.\n2. The linear model\nWe look at how the linear model can be used to address research questions in the context of the Clearly understood health comprehension project. But I aim to outline some general ideas about why we use the linear model technique, and how it works. I build on work you have done with Margriet Groen in earlier PSYC122 classes, so that we can strengthen understanding, and extend skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo work with the recordings:\n\nWatch the video parts right through.\nUse the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\nTry out the coding exercises in the how-to and the workbook (see Section 5.1) to see for yourself how you can construct visualizations and do analyses.\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how we use the linear model to estimate the association between (1.) an outcome like mean accuracy of understanding and (2.) a predictor like vocabulary knowledge: estimating the association as the expected change in the average outcome given variation in the predictor.\nIn the plot on the right of Figure 1, we show the distribution curve of mean (comprehension) accuracy scores observed at each value of vocabulary. You can see that the middle – the average – of each distribution, marked by a line, increases as we go from left (low scores) to right (high scores).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Plots showing the association between the outcome mean accuracy of understanding a predictor, vocabulary knowledge. Both plots show the same data. The plot on the right is modified to show how accuracy of understanding varies between individuals in the sample with the sample vocabulary test scores\n\n\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how the information we get from a linear model allows us to predict the way in which outcome values may vary (increase or decrease), given different values in the predictor variable.\nWe could form a prediction line anywhere but the linear model helps us to estimate the prediction (“best fit”) line that minimizes the differences between observed and predicted outcomes: the residuals, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Plot showing the prediction of mean accuracy of understanding, given information about participant vocabulary knowledge, with lines drawn to show the difference between observed outcomes (shown in orange-red) and predicted outcomes (shown as black circles on the blue line) for each vocabulary test score value in our sample\n\n\n\n\nThe lectures end with a discussion of the critical information you must identify and extract when you view the summary of a linear model results.\nI then show you how to report the results. I give you examples of the conventional language you can use to report your results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn reporting linear model results, we need to explain what they tell us about the association between outcome and predictor variables.\n\n\nWe can use visualization to help us to interpret the model estimates. In the how-to guide and in the lab activity workbook (see Section 5.1), we look at how you can draw prediction plots, given model estimates.\n\nLinks to other classes\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about, in PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\nThe lectures in PSYC123 on: (week 2) reliability and validity; (week 3) experimental design, especially between-subjects studies and individual differences; and (week 9) precise hypotheses.\nThe lecture in PSYC122 (week 13) introducing the linear model.\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 1\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n\n\n\nSurvey information\nThe survey asks you to:\n\ncomplete some questions about who you are;\nand then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.\n\nThe survey then asks you to:\n\nread five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;\nrespond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;\nand rate how well you think you understand the advice.\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.

Thinking critically about how people vary, and about the robustness and generalizability of results in psychological science\nWe shall proceed to answer our research questions with the data we have collected with the help of PSYC122 students. As we do this, we should reflect on where the data come from – the fact that people vary, and results vary – and we should consider, critically, questions concerning key ideas:\n\nMethods reproducibility – Will a different researcher be able to get the same results if they analyze the same data?\nResults reproducibility – Will we get the same results if we collect new data using the same procedure?\n\nThese questions are part of our motivation for recommending open science practices.\n2. What the PSYC122 data tell us: the possible answers to our research questions\nWe have been working to develop understanding and skills using example questions, tasks and data developed within the health comprehension Clearly understood project. PSYC122 students contributed their responses to a version of the survey we have been using to collect data to find answers to our research questions. In our practical work, we will be examining the PSYC122 data but as we do so we should understand that no one study in psychological science will give us definitive answers to any interesting question about people and what they do. In the lecture, we reflect on how data from different studies – using the same methods, with the same aims – may nevertheless vary:\n\nvary in the data distributions\nand vary in the results that analyses indicate.\n\nCritically evaluating results across a series of studies, or replication attempts, is part of the process of accumulating evidence to build insight in psychological science, given measurement under uncertainty and limits in our samples.\n3. Growing in independence, working with free open R\nR is free open source software. This is critical to ensuring that when we do analyses with psychological data we can usefully share data and code in ways that help to build evidence and insight in psychological science.\nBut there is a bigger benefit: the vast, free, R knowledge ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEvery problem you ever have:\n\nsomeone has had it before\nsolved it\nand written a blog (or tweet or toot) or recorded a YouTube or TikTok about it\n\n\n\nIn the week 19 lecture, and in the practical materials, we start to look at how you can locate and use the information you need to do data analysis. But it is important that you recognize two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nEverything you need is out there, you just need to learn how to find it.\nSharing knowledge about R represents a new way to share scientific information: maybe this – not books or journals – is the future.\n\n\n\n\nThe lectures: the implications of our results, the revolution in open science and being a part of the revolution\nLast, we set up questions for you to consider:\n\nWhat are the results of our analyses with the new data?\nWhat are the implications for health communication?\n\nThen we step back, and consider how we are learning to work in terms of the modern workflow, and the on-going revolution in open science, and how people now build and share knowledge."

For solo workers, increasing communication with clients and stake- holders may provide similar benefits.\nPassive risk appetites and poor risk mitigation strategies are likely linked with intuitive system 1 processing and less reflective thinking.\nSocial identities assumed by software developers can have a profound impact on their feelings of responsibility and motivation towards their role in the development process."

    "text": "Discussion\n\nThe finding that cognitive reflection or optimism alone explain very little variance in security perceptions highlights the entangled nature of cognition in the real-world\nOverly optimistic software engineers view additional security implementation as holding minimal value, as they believe their current level of security to be sufficient. When considering security, therefore, they may require stronger cues or framing to activate system 2 when making security decisions\nOne catalyst for system 2 thinking during secure decision making might be peer communication, which allows for the balancing of perspectives and a reduction of biases.\nThe use of rewards, either intrinsic or extrinsic, for encouraging secure coding behaviours can be used to increase motivation and subsequently increase task performance.\n\n\nintrinsic rewards are those internal to the individual and are inherently found in the task itself and upon completion, and extrinsic rewards are external to the task, such as pay or recognition\nThe exact nature of verifying secure coding practices on freelance platforms is beyond the scope of this paper, but if a system can be devised that is universally trusted and easily implementable, then the use of gamification may work as a reward system."
