    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapter you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Calculating Chi-square by hand and interpreting the results\nIs there a relationship between the number of people who smoke and the number of people who drink? Please note that the question is the number of people (frequency) and not how much people drink/smoke. Also not that these are fictitious data. You’ll need a table of critical values for Chi-square. This can be found in the ‘Week 14 – resources’ folder on Moodle.\n\nPre-lab activity questions:\n\nComplete the Pearson’s Chi-square test by hand using the data above and fill in the blanks:\n\n\\(\\chi 2\\) ( , N = ) = , p\n\nCan you reject the null hypothesis?\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Data visualisation - Creating a bar chart\nWe’ve mostly been using the ggplot2 package for visualising data. You can read a great overview of the ggplot2 package here. It also links to a ‘cheatsheet’ that you can download as a .pdf document. Lots of useful info on there!\nWith regard to visualising relations between categorical variables, the geom_bar() function is important. The following ‘recipe’ summarises what it does and how to use it.\n\nTASK Have a look at the ‘recipe’ and read through it. Try to understand each step. Going through the example is particularly helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipes - how to use them\n\n\n\nEach ‘recipe’ has the same structure.\n\nFirst, it summarises what it is that you want to achieve when using that specific function. In the case of select() it says “You want to extract specific columns from a data frame and return them as a new, smaller data frame.”\nThen, it outlines a number of steps that you need to carry out when using this function. For select() it outlines 2 steps: 1. Pass the dataframe to the function. 2. List the column(s) to return.\nFinally, there is an example talks you through using the function with some data. For select() it uses an example with data on the weather.\nAdditional information appears in extra boxes with a light-bulb icon. If you find those confusing, don’t worry about them at this stage.\n\n\n\n\ngeom_bar() - create a bar chart - recipe\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 122_week14_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below."

L. (2016). Reminders through association. Psychological Science, 27, 973-986. You can read the full paper online but the short version is that the authors looked at how people remember to follow through with the intention of doing something.\nAlthough there are lots of potential reasons (e.g., some people may lack the self-control resources), Rogers and Milkman (2016) propose that some people fail to follow through simply because they forget about their good intentions. If this is the case, the authors argue, then having visual reminders to follow through on their intentions may help people remember to keep them. For example, a person may choose to put a sticker for their gym on their car window, so that every time they get in the car they remember to go to the gym.\nIn Study 1 by Rogers and colleagues, participants took part in an unrelated experiment but at the start of the task they were asked to return a small stack of paper clips to the reception of the building at the end of the study and if they did so the researchers would donate $1 to a charity. They were then asked if they intended to do this. Those in the reminder-through-association (RTA) condition read “Thank you! To remind you to pick up a paper clip, an elephant statuette will be sitting on the counter as you collect your payment.” This message was followed by a picture of the elephant statuette. Those in the control condition simply read “Thank you!”.\nWhat we want to do is to run a chi-square analysis to determine whether those in the RTA condition were more likely to remember to return the paper-clips than those in the control condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we begin\n\n\n\nLet’s put the basics in place:\n\nMake sure you have started a new R Markdown script. If you need a reminder of how to do that, please revisit week 6 of PSYC121 (here).\nYou’ll need the data file RTA_study1.csv you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 3. If you experienced issues with uploading files to the server, follow the instructions below.\nWhen starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one.\nFinally, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data files (RTA_study1.csv).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week14/RTA_study1.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"RTA_study1.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning the R environment\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can clean the R environment by clicking on the broom icon at the top right of the environment window, or you can use the code below.\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking your working directory\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the code below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the ‘Files’ pane on the right. Does it contain the data files?\n\ngetwd()\n\nIf your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the ‘Files’ pane, click ‘More’ and then on ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Add the code to load the relevant libraries in a new code chunk. We need the following ones: lsr and tidyverse. If you are unsure, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library()function. Remember to put it inside a ‘code chunk’ in your R Markdown script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(lsr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Read in the data, have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv()function to read in the data and the head() function to have a quick look at each data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nintent_data &lt;- read_csv(\"RTA_study1.csv\")                                 # Read in the data file\n\nhead(intent_data)                                                         # Look at the table\n\n\n\nIt is a fairly simple data file that contains four variables for 87 participants:\n\ncondition: this variable indicates which condition participants were in (1 = reminder-through-association condition, 2 = control condition)\nintend: this variable indicates whether participants said they were intending to return the paper-clips (1 = yes, 0 = no)\nactualdonate: this variable indicates whether participants actually ended up returning the paper-clips and therefore donating to charity (1 = yes, 0 = no)\nid: this variable indicates the participant ID number\n\n\nQuestion 2a: What do the numbers in the first row across the four columns refer to?\n\n\nStep 3. Getting the data ready. We need to do a little bit of wrangling to get our data into the format we need: First, we need to remove all the participants who said that they did not intend to return the paper-clips (intend = 0) as we are only interested in whether people follow through on an intention. Second, to make the output easier to read, we’re going to recode condition to have text labels rather than numerical values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use filter() to remove all participants who said that they did not intend to return the paper-clips. You can use mutate() and recode() to recode the values in condition to make ‘1 = rta’ and ‘2 = control’, and the values in actualdonate to ‘1 = donated’ and ‘0 = no_donation’. Finally, save the output to a new object.\nYou can do this in two separate steps, or you can use pipes. Also, note that you will need to put both sides of each recode argument (i.e., 1 and rta) in quotation marks, even though 1 and 2 are numbers, they actually represent categories rather than numerical data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nintent_recode &lt;- intent_data %&gt;%\n  filter(intend == 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(condition = recode(condition, \"1\" = \"rta\", \"2\" = \"control\"),\n         actualdonate = recode(actualdonate, \"1\" = \"donated\", \"0\" = \"no_donation\"))\n\nhead(intent_recode)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3a: How many participants were removed because they didn’t intend to return the paper-clips?\n\n\nStep 4. Next you need to calculate descriptive statistics. For frequency data these are simply counts so we can use the function count() rather than having to use the summarise() function. We want to know how many participants are in each group (rta - donated, rta - didn’t donate, control - donated, control - didn’t donate) so we will need to use group_by() to display the results for all combinations of condition and actualdonate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the code template below to develop the code. You need to replace the various bits in CAPITALS.\nNEW_OBJECT &lt;- DATA_TO_USE %&gt;%\ngroup_by(FIRST_GROUPING_VARIABLE, SECOND_GROUPING_VARIABLE) %&gt;%\n  count()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nintent_counts &lt;- intent_recode %&gt;%\ngroup_by(condition, actualdonate) %&gt;%\n  count()\n\nintent_counts\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4a: How many participants in the control condition didn’t donate?\n\n\nQuestion 4b: How many participants in the control condition donated?\n\n\nQuestion 4c: How many participants in the rta condition didn’t donate?\n\n\nQuestion 4d: How many participants in the rta condition donated?\n\nYou may also want to calculate the percentages of participants in each condition. Run this code to do this. Make sure to replace RECODED_DATA with the name of your dataframe in which you have recoded the original data values with string labels (in Step 3).\n\nintent_percent &lt;- intent_recode %&gt;%\n  group_by(condition, actualdonate) %&gt;%\n  count() %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;% # ungroups the data\n  group_by(condition) %&gt;% # then groups it again but just by condition\n  mutate(percent_condition = n/sum(n) * 100)\n\nintent_percent\n\n\nStep 5. Data visualiation. We want to create a simple bar plot of our count data. We’ll use ggplot() for this in combination with the geom_bar() function. Use the code template below and make sure to fill in the relevant bits.\n\n\nggplot(data = , aes(x = , fill = )) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nggplot(data = intent_recode, aes(x = condition, fill = actualdonate)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5a: What does position = \"dodge\" do? Remove it and rerun the code to find out.\n\nAs you can see, the plot makes it much easier to visualise the data - participants in the RTA condition appear to have been more likely to remember to donate than those in the control condition.\nThe ggplot2() package allows you to customise all aspects of your plots, so let’s tidy ours up a little bit. We’re going to do the following:\n\nEdit the labels on the x-axis, y-axis and fill.\nChange the colours of the bars by using scale_fill_manual() and specifying the colours we want in the values argument\nChange the theme of the plot to change how it looks\n\nThe code below does this.\n\nTASK Add a comment to each line to indicate what that line does.\n\n\nggplot(data = intent_recode, aes(x = condition, fill = actualdonate)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"Condition\", labels = c(\"Control\", \"RTA\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Count\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Behaviour\", labels = c(\"Donated\", \"Did not donate\"), values = c(\"blue\", \"grey\"))+\n  theme_classic()\n\nThere are a few things to note about the code we just added on:\n\nIf you use simple colour names then you are restricted in the options you can choose, however, if you want more flexibility you can use hexadecimal colour codes, see here.\nThere are multiple themes that you can apply. Have a look at the ggplot2() cheatsheet for an overview (here. Try out a few and see which one you prefer.\n\n\nStep 6. Now let’s run that chi-square analysis to see whether our impression from the plot holds up and there is a significant association between the grouping variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the chisq.test() function. Remember to use the recoded data to make the output easier to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nresults &lt;- chisq.test(x = intent_recode$condition,        # the first grouping variable\n                      y = intent_recode$actualdonate,     # the second grouping variable\n                      correct = FALSE)                    # whether we want to apply the continuity correction (use if any of the expected cell frequencies &lt; 10 in 2 x 2 table)\nresults\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6a: What do you conclude from the output?\n\n\nStep 7. Check the assumptions.\n\nThe assumptions for chi-square are as follows:\n\nThe data in the cells should be frequencies, or counts of cases rather than percentages.\nThe levels (or categories) of the variables are mutually exclusive. That is, a particular participant fits into one and only one group of each of the variables.\nEach participant may contribute data to one and only one cell. If, for example, the same participants are tested over time such that the comparisons are of the same subjects at Time 1, Time 2, Time 3, etc., then Chi-square may not be used.\nThe study groups must be independent. This means that a different test must be used if the two groups are related. For example, a different test must be used if the researcher’s data consists of paired samples, such as in studies in which a parent is paired with his or her child.\nThere are 2 variables, and both are measured as categories, usually at the nominal level. While Chi-square has no rule about limiting the number of cells (by limiting the number of categories for each variable), a very large number of cells (over 20) can make it difficult to meet assumption #6 below, and to interpret the meaning of the results.\nThe expected cell frequencies should be greater than 5.\n\nAssumptions 1) to 5) should be evaluated by reviewing the design of the study. The only assumption that we need to check with R is whether all expected frequencies are greater than 5.\n\nTASK Write the code to check that all expected frequencies are greater than 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information we need is in the object in which your stored the results of the Chi-square test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nresults$expected\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7a: What do you conclude from the output?\n\n\nStep 8. The last step before writing up the results is to calculate an effect size so that we have a standardised measure of how large the association between our grouping variables is, the effect size measure for chi-square is Cramer’s V. To calculate Cramer’s V we’re going to use the function cramersv() from the lsr package. The code mirrors the code used for the Chi-square test itself:\n\n\neff_size &lt;- cramersV(x = intent_recode$condition,     # the first grouping variable\n                     y = intent_recode$actualdonate,  # the second grouping variable\n                     correct = FALSE)                  # whether we want to apply the continuity correction (use if any of the expected cell frequencies &lt; 10 in 2 x 2 table)\neff_size\n\nWe can square the effect size (or multiple it by itself) to see how much variance in one variable is accounted for by the other variable. Use the code snippet below to square the effect size.\n\npercentageAccountedFor &lt;- eff_size * eff_size *100\npercentageAccountedFor\n\n\nQuestion 8a: How large is the effect and how much variance is accounted for?\n\n\nStep 9. To help with interpreting the relationships, it is useful to look at the standardised residuals. These are z-scores that indicate how many standard deviations above or below the expected count, an observed count is (thus indicating how much they differ). Remember, for z-scores the following holds: +/- 1.96, p &lt;.05, +/- 2.58 p &lt;.01, +/-3.29 p &lt; .001\n\n\nresults$residuals   # check the standardised residuals\n\n\nQuestion 9a: What do you conclude from the output?\n\n\nStep 10. Write up the results following APA guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Purdue writing lab website is helpful for guidance on punctuating statistics."

For now, let’s say we’ll therefore calculate Spearman’s rho, rather than Pearson’s r. That is ok for now, but if you were analysing these data for a research project, you’d want to have a closer look at the age variable (think histogram, qq-plot, and think about either collecting more data from older participants or transforming the variable (more about that next year)."

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapter you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Visualising the regression line\nHave a look at this visualisation of the regression line by Ryan Safner.\nIn this shiny app, you see a randomly-generated set of data points (within specific parameters, to keep the graph scaled properly). You can choose a slope and intercept for the regression line by using the sliders. The graph also displays the residuals as dashed red lines. Moving the slope or the intercept too much causes the generated line to create much larger residuals. The shiny app also calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the standard error of the regression (SER), which calculates the average size of the error (the red numbers). These numbers reflect how well the regression line fits the data, but you don’t need to worry about those for now.\nIn the app he uses the equation Y = aX + b in which b is the intercept and a is the slope.\nThis is slightly different from the equation you saw during the lecture. There we talked about Y = b0 + b1*X + e. Same equation, just different letters. So b0 in the lecture is equivalent to b in the app and b1 in the lecture is equivalent to a in the app.\nPre-lab activity questions:\n\nChange the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line?\nChange the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line?\nWhat happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line?\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Data visualisation - practice with ggplot2()\nWe’ve mostly been using the ggplot2 package for visualising data. You can read a great overview of the ggplot2 package here. It also links to a ‘cheatsheet’ that you can download as a .pdf document. Lots of useful info on there!\nWith regard to visualising relations between continuous variables, the geom_point() function in combination with the geom_line() function is important. Also remember that it always a good idea to make sure you’ve given you axes informative labels (using the labs() function). You’ve used these functions before, but the following ‘recipes’ summarise what each one does and how to use it.\n\nTASK Have a look at each ‘recipe’ and read through it. Try to understand each step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipes - how to use them\n\n\n\nEach ‘recipe’ has the same structure.\n\nFirst, it summarises what it is that you want to achieve when using that specific function. In the case of select() it says “You want to extract specific columns from a data frame and return them as a new, smaller data frame.”\nThen, it outlines a number of steps that you need to carry out when using this function. For select() it outlines 2 steps: 1. Pass the dataframe to the function. 2. List the column(s) to return.\nFinally, there is an example talks you through using the function with some data. For select() it uses an example with data on the weather.\nAdditional information appears in extra boxes with a light-bulb icon. If you find those confusing, don’t worry about them at this stage.\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() - create a scatterplot - recipe\ngeom_line() - add a regression line - there is no recipe, but have a look at the ggplot2() cheatsheet mentioned earlier\nlabs() - change the axes labels - recipe\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 122_week13_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created (see last week’s Pre-lab activity 4 for instructions on how to do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below."

The distance between the fitted values (the line) and the observed values (the dots) increases. Therefore, the red dashed lines become longer suggesting that the residuals increase. The model therefore fits the data less well.\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 2: Statistics anxiety and engagement in module activities\nIn this lab, we’ll be working with real data and using regression to explore the question of whether there is a relationship between statistics anxiety and engagement in course activities.\n\nBackground\nThe hypothesis is that students who are more anxious about statistics are less likely to engage in course-related activities. This avoidance behaviour could ultimately be responsible for lower performance for these students (although we won’t be examining the assessment scores in this activity).\nWe are going to analyse data from the STARS Statistics Anxiety Survey, which was administered to students in the third-year statistics course in Psychology at the University of Glasgow. All the responses have been anonymised by associating the responses for each student with an arbitrary ID number (integer).\nThe STARS survey (Cruise, Cash, & Bolton, 1985) is a 51-item questionnaire, with each response on a 1 to 5 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater anxiety.\nCruise, R. J., Cash, R. W., & Bolton, D. L. (1985). Development and validation of an instrument to measure statistical anxiety. Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, Section on Statistical Education, Las Vegas, NV.\nExample items from the STARS survey\n\nAs a measure of engagement in the course, we will use data from Moodle usage analytics. Over the course of the term, there were eight optional weekly on-line sessions that students could attend for extra support. The variable n_weeks in the psess.csv file tells you how many (out of eight) a given student attended.\nOur hypothesis was that greater anxiety would be reflected in lower engagement. Answer the following question.\n\nQuestion 1a: If our hypothesis is correct, what type of correlation (if any) should we observe between students’ mean anxiety levels and the variable n_weeks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we begin\n\n\n\nLet’s put the basics in place:\n\nMake sure you have started a new R Markdown script. If you need a reminder of how to do that, please revisit week 6 of PSYC121 (here).\nYou’ll need the data files stars2.csv and psess.csv you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 3. If you experienced issues with uploading files to the server, follow the instructions below.\nWhen starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one.\nFinally, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data files (stars2.csv and psess.csv).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week13/stars2.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"stars2.csv\")\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week13/psess.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"psess.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning the R environment\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can clean the R environment by clicking on the broom icon at the top right of the environment window, or you can use the code below.\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking your working directory\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the code below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the ‘Files’ pane on the right. Does it contain the data files?\n\ngetwd()\n\nIf your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the ‘Files’ pane, click ‘More’ and then on ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Add the code to load the relevant libraries in a new code chunk. We need the following ones: broom, car and tidyverse. If you are unsure, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library()function. Remember to put it inside a ‘code chunk’ in your R Markdown script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Read in both files, have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv()function to read in the data and the head() function to have a quick look at each data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nstars &lt;- read_csv(\"stars2.csv\")\nengage &lt;- read_csv(\"psess.csv\")\n\nhead(stars) # Look at the data frames\nhead(engage)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2a: In the stars data frame, what do the numbers in the first row across the three columns refer to?\n\n\nStep 3. Getting the data ready. Now that we’ve read in both data files, the next step is to calculate the mean anxiety scores for each participant. At the moment we have scores on all questions separately for each participant in the stars table. Instead we need one mean anxiety score for each participant. Write the code to calculate mean anxiety scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that participant is identified by the ID variable. Use group_by() and summarise(). Store the resulting table in a variable named stars_mean. Also, remember to use na.rm = TRUE when calculating the mean scores to deal with participants who have missing data (NAs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nstars_means &lt;- stars %&gt;%\n  group_by(ID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_anxiety = mean(Score, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3a: What is the mean anxiety score for participant 3?\n\nOk, before we get ahead of ourselves, in order to perform the regression analysis we need to combine the data from stars (the mean anxiety scores) with the data from engage (n_weeks).\n\nTASK: Join the two tables, call the resulting table joined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the inner_join() function (making use of the variable that is common across both tables) to join.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\njoined &lt;- inner_join(stars_means, engage, \"ID\")\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. We now need descriptive statistics for both variables. Calculate the mean and standard deviations for the anxiety scores and the engagement data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the summarise() function, in combination with the mean() and sd() functions to do this. Remember to use na.rm = TRUE when calculating the mean scores to deal with participants who have missing data (NAs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\ndescriptives &lt;- joined %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_anx = mean(mean_anxiety, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_anx = sd(mean_anxiety, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_weeks = mean(n_weeks, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_weeks = sd(n_weeks, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4a: What are the means and standard deviation for anxiety and engagement with the statistics module?\n\n\nStep 5. Visualise the data. As always, it is a good idea to visualise your data. Now that we have all the variables in one place, make a scatterplot of anxiety as a function of engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this you’ll need the ggplot() function together withgeom_point()andgeom_smooth(). Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels with thelabs()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nggplot(joined, aes(x = mean_anxiety, y = n_weeks)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Anxiety\", y = \"Engagement\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5a: What does the scatterplot suggest about the relationship between anxiety and engagement?\n\n\nStep 6. With all the variables in place, we’re ready now to start building the regression model. Use the lm() function to run the regression model in which you model engagement (the outcome variable) as a function of anxiety (the predictor variable) and use the summary() function to look at the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the template below. Replace the ‘outcome’, ‘predictor’ and ‘my_data’ parts with the relevant info.\nmod &lt;-lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = my_data)\nmod_summary &lt;- summary(mod)\nmod_summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nmod &lt;- lm(n_weeks ~ mean_anxiety, data = joined)\nmod_summary &lt;- summary(mod)\nmod_summary\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6a: What is the estimate of the y-intercept for the model, rounded to three decimal places?\n\n\nQuestion 6b: To three decimal places, if the General Linear Model for this model is Y=beta0 + beta1X + e, then the value of beta1 is …\n\n\nQuestion 6c: To three decimal places, for each unit increase in anxiety, engagement decreases by …\n\n\nQuestion 6d: To two decimal places, what is the overall F-value of the model?\n\n\nQuestion 6e: Is the overall model significant?\n\n\nQuestion 6f: What proportion of the variance does the model explain?\n\n\nStep 7. Now that we’ve fitted a model, let’s check whether the model meets the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity. Write the code to create the plots that allow you to check the assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\ncrPlots() to check linearity, qqPlot() to check normality of the residuals, and residualPlot() to check homoscedasticity of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below\ncrPlots(mod)            # Plot linear line and line that best fits the data to check the relationship between outcome and predictor is linear\n\nqqPlot(mod$residuals)   # Create qq-plot to check residuals are normally distributed\n\nresidualPlot(mod)      # Create residual plot to check residual show homoscedasticity\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7a: Does the relationship appear to be linear?\n\n\nQuestion 7b: Do the residuals show normality?\n\n\nQuestion 7c: Do the residuals show homoscedasticity?\n\n\nStep 8. Finally, it’s time to write up the results following APA guidelines. What would the results section look like if you wrote them up, following APA guidelines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Purdue writing lab website is helpful for guidance on punctuating statistics."

What is the mean anxiety score for participant 3?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n1.058824\n\n\n\n4a. What are the means and standard deviation for anxiety and engagement with the statistics module?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnxiety M = 2.08, SD = 0.56; Engagement M = 4.54, SD = 2.42.\n\n\n\n5a. What does the scatterplot suggest about the relationship between anxiety and engagement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThat there might indeed be a relatively strong negative correlation between the two; students with more anxiety, engage less.\n\n\n\n6a. What is the estimate of the y-intercept for the model, rounded to three decimal places?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n9.057. Explanation: In the summary table, this is the estimate of the intercept.\n\n\n\n6b. To three decimal places, if the General Linear Model for this model is Y=beta0 + beta1X + e, then the value of beta1 is …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n-2.173. Explanation: In the summary table, this is the estimate of mean_anxiety, i.e., the slope.\n\n\n\n6c. To three decimal places, for each unit increase in anxiety, engagement decreases by …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n2.173. Explanation: In the summary table, this is also the estimate of mean_anxiety, the slope is how much it decreases so you just remove the - sign.\n\n\n\n6d. To two decimal places, what is the overall F-ratio of the model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n11.99. Explanation: In the summary table, the F-ratio is noted as the F-statistic.\n\n\n\n6e. Is the overall model significant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Explanation: The overall model p-value is .001428 which is less than .05, therefore significant.\n\n\n\n6f. What proportion of the variance does the model explain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n25.52%. Explanation: The variance explained is determined by R-squared, you simply multiple it by 100 to get the percent.\n\n\n\n7a. Does the relationship appear to be linear?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the pink line roughly falls across the dashed blue line and looks mostly linear.\n\n\n\n7b. Do the residuals show normality?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, in the qq-plot the open circles mostly assemble around the solid blue line, and fall mostly within the range of the dashed blue lines.\n\n\n\n7c. Do the residuals show homoscedasticity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the residual plot shows that the spread of the residuals is roughly similar for different fitted values.\n\n\n\n\nWhat would the results section look like if you wrote them up, following APA guidelines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple linear regression was performed with engagement (M = 4.54, SD = 0.56) as the outcome variable and statistics anxiety (M = 2.08, SD = 0.56) as the predictor variable. The results of the regression indicated that the model significantly predicted course engagement (F(1, 35) = 11.99, p &lt; .001, R^2 = 0.25), accounting for 25% of the variance. Anxiety was a significant negative predictor (beta = -2.17, p &lt; 0.001): as anxiety increased, course engagement decreased."

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to PSYC122!\nThis module builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in Statistics for Psychologists 1 (PSYC121). You will continue to practise data handling, data processing and data visualisation, using R and R Studio. In addition, you will learn about statistical methods to test whether two (or more) variables are associated and how to implement those methods in R and R Studio.\nWatch the video below (~ 5 minutes) to get a short overview of the topics we will cover in weeks 11 to 15.\n\nThis page gives you access to all the materials that you will need. You will have timetabled lab classes during which you are expected to work through a series of exercises to practise that week’s material. Before you come to your lab session, you should watch the lectures for that week, read the relevant book chapter and complete the pre-lab activities. Following all that and to check that you’ve understood the week’s materials, you can complete a quick quiz.\nThere will be class tests in weeks 15 and 20. These take place, in person, during your regular lab session.\n\n\nAsking for help\nWe have carefully prepared and refined the lab materials in this course over several years, and we feel that the pace of the materials is just right for our students. Some students will complete them more quickly, and others more slowly - both of these scenarios are absolutely fine. You should work at the pace that suits you best, making sure you understand the materials before you move forward.\nIt is fairly inevitable that you will get stuck on the lab materials in this module at some point. This might be in Week 11, Week 12, or later. When you do, it’s important you reach out for help:\n\nAsk your friends on your table. We’ve designed this teaching space to help collaborative work. You are encouraged to work with other students. Make sure you ask others to explain how they’ve solved an exercise. Make sure you help out others where you can. Always make sure you understand the code and the exercise; don’t simply be satisfied that you’ve got the right answer.\nAsk a GTA or Lecturer. Our Graduate Teaching Assistants are there to help you. There are no “stupid questions” in statistics, so just ask the GTAs any question about what you’re doing. Likewise, ask the Lecturer.\nAsk on the Discussion Forum. On the PSYC122 moodle page you will find a Discussion Forum. This is a great way to ask a question outside of the lab sessions. It might seem scary to ask a question in the forum, but please don’t be afraid to do this. If you have a question, you can bet 30+ other students also have the same question! So by asking the question on the forum, you help out many more people on the module. A friendly GTA or Lecturer will be along to answer the question as soon as possible (we aim for within 48 hours during the working week).\nAsk on the module Q & A session. Each week we hold a “Q&A” online session where we will try and resolve any general queries and problems. It’s an ideal time to discuss things that students are struggling with or confused about, and can share ideas and answers. You can ask on the discussion forum above and then we might be able to pick up the issues and discuss them, but also you can ask in the session itself.\n\n\n\nCourse Contacts\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nMargriet Groen\nm.groen at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\nRob Davies\nr.davies1 at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Data-wrangling with dplyr\nData comes in lots of different formats. One of the most common formats is that of a two-dimensional table (the two dimensions being rows and columns). Usually, each row stands for a separate observation (e.g. a participant), and each column stands for a different variable (e.g. a response, category, or group). A key benefit of tabular data is that it allows you to store different types of data-numerical measurements, alphanumeric labels, categorical descriptors-all in one place.\nIt may surprise you to learn that scientists actually spend far more of time cleaning and preparing their data than they spend actually analysing it. This means completing tasks such as cleaning up bad values, changing the structure of tables, merging information stored in separate tables, reducing the data down to a subset of observations, and producing data summaries. Some have estimated that up to 80% of time spent on data analysis involves such data preparation tasks (Dasu & Johnson, 2003)!\nMany people seem to operate under the assumption that the only option for data cleaning is the painstaking and time-consuming cutting and pasting of data within a spreadsheet program like Excel. We have witnessed students and colleagues waste days, weeks, and even months manually transforming their data in Excel, cutting, copying, and pasting data. Fixing up your data by hand is not only a terrible use of your time, but it is error-prone and not reproducible. Additionally, in this age where we can easily collect massive datasets online, you will not be able to organise, clean, and prepare these by hand.\nIn short, you will not thrive as a psychologist if you do not learn some key data wrangling skills. Although every dataset presents unique challenges, there are some systematic principles you should follow that will make your analyses easier, less error-prone, more efficient, and more reproducible.\nThe functions you’ll need in lab activity 2 include select(), filter(), mutate(), group_by() and summarise() from the dplyr package.\nYou’ve used these functions before, but the following ‘recipes’ summarise what each one does and how to use it.\n\nTASK Have a look at each ‘recipe’ and read through it. Try to understand each step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipes - how to use them\n\n\n\nEach ‘recipe’ has the same structure.\n\nFirst, it summarises what it is that you want to achieve when using that specific function. In the case of select() it says “You want to extract specific columns from a data frame and return them as a new, smaller data frame.”\nThen, it outlines a number of steps that you need to carry out when using this function. For select() it outlines 2 steps: 1. Pass the dataframe to the function. 2. List the column(s) to return.\nFinally, there is an example talks you through using the function with some data. For select() it uses an example with data on the weather.\nAdditional information appears in extra boxes with a light-bulb icon. If you find those confusing, don’t worry about them at this stage.\n\n\n\n\nselect() - extract variables (columns) - recipe\nfilter() - extract observations (rows)- recipe\nmutate() - create a new variable (column) - recipe\ngroup_by() - organise the observations into groups - recipe\nsummarise() - compute summary statistics - recipe\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 122_week12_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created (see last week’s Pre-lab activity 4 for instructions on how to do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below."

Now we really want to see what you can do yourself. In this activity we’ll use real data on implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping.\n\nBackground\nExplicit attitudes were measured via a questionnaire where higher scores indicated a positive attitude towards vaping (VapingQuestionaireScore). Implicit attitudes were measured through an Implicit Association Test (IAT) using images of Vaping and Kitchen utensils and associating them with positive and negative words.\nThe IAT works on the principal that associations that go together (that are congruent, e.g. warm and sun) should be quicker to respond to than associations that do not go together (that are incongruent, e.g. warm and ice). You can read up more on the procedure on the Noba Project which has a good description of the procedure under the section “Subtle/Nonsconscious Research Methods”.\nFor this exercise, you need to know that “Block 3” in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards congruent associations, pairing positive words with Kitchen utensils and negative words with Vaping. “Block 5” in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards incongruent associations, pairing positive words with Vaping and negative words with Kitchen Utensils. As such, if reaction times were longer in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is negative (i.e. congruent associations are quicker than incongruent associations). However, if reaction times were quicker in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is positive (i.e. incongruent associations were quicker than congruent associations). The difference between reaction times in Block5 and Block3 is called the participants’ IAT score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we begin\n\n\n\nLet’s put the basics in place:\n\nMake sure you have started a new R Markdown script. If you need a reminder of how to do that, please revisit week 6 of PSYC121 (here).\nYou’ll need the data file VapingData.csv you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 2. If you experienced issues with uploading files to the server, follow the instructions below.\nWhen starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one.\nFinally, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data file (VapingData.csv).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week12/122_week12_forStudents/VapingData.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"VapingData.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning the R environment\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can clean the R environment by clicking on the broom icon at the top right of the environment window, or you can use the code below.\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking your working directory\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the code below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the ‘Files’ pane on the right. Does it contain the data file (‘VapingData.csv’)?\n\ngetwd()\n\nIf your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the ‘Files’ pane, click ‘More’ and then on ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Add the code to load the relevant libraries in a new code chunk. We need the following ones: broom, car, Hmisc, lsr and tidyverse. If you are unsure, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library()function. Remember to put it inside a ‘code chunk’ in your R Markdown script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nlibrary(lsr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Read in the data. The data file we’ll be working with is VapingData.csv. Have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it. You have 8 columns. Reaction times and Accuracy scores for Blocks 3 and 5 as well as the Explicit Vaping Questionnaire scores, Sex and Age, for each participant.\n\nQuestion 2a: For how many participants do we have data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv()function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"VapingData.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Data wrangling. The data are not in a shape yet that we can actually use for our analysis. We’ll have to do some ’data wrangling to knock them into shape. We need to take the following into account:\n\n\n\nAccuracy was calculated as proportion and as such can’t go above 1. Participants entered their own data so some might have made a mistake. Remove participants who had an accuracy greater than 1 in either Block 3 or Block 5 as we are unclear on the accuracy of these values.\n\n\n\n\nWe also only want participants who were paying attention so best remove anybody whose average accuracy score across Blocks 3 and 5 was less than 80%. Note - this value is arbitrary and if you wanted, in your own experiment, you could use a more relaxed or strict cut-off based on other studies or guidance. Note that these decisions should be set out at the start of your research as part of your pre-registration or as part of your Registered Report. Finally, in this instance, remember, the values are in proportions not percentages (so 80% will be .8).\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have removed data points that were the result of data entry mistakes or came from participants who didn’t pay attention during the task, we create an IAT score for participants by subtracting Block 3 reaction times (RT) from Block 5 reaction times (IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT).\n\n\n\nLook closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does.\n\n\ndat &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  filter(IAT_BLOCK3_Acc &lt; 1) %&gt;%\n  filter(IAT_BLOCK5_Acc &lt; 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(IAT_ACC = (IAT_BLOCK3_Acc + IAT_BLOCK5_Acc)/2) %&gt;%\n  filter(IAT_ACC &gt; .8) %&gt;%\n  mutate(IAT_RT = IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nYou might want to revisit the ‘recipes’ for filter() and mutate() we looked at in pre-lab activity 1 (here Section 3) to remind yourself what these functions do and how to use them.\n\n\nQuestion 3a: For how many participants do we have data now that we have cleaned them up?\nQuestion 3b: Use the information in the background description to understand how the scores relate to attitudes. What does a positive IAT_RT score reflect? What does a negative IAT_RT score reflect? What does a higher score on the ‘VapingQuestionnaireScore’ mean?\n\nStep 4. Calculating descriptive statistics. Now that we have the variables that we need and the data cleaned up, we will create a descriptives summary of the number of people, and the means for the IAT and Vaping Questionnaire Score. Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does.\n\n\ndescriptives &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean_IAT_ACC = mean(IAT_ACC),\n            mean_IAT_RT = mean(IAT_RT),\n            mean_VPQ = mean(VapingQuestionnaireScore, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nQuestion 4a: Why might these averages be useful? Why are averages not always useful in correlations?\n\nStep 5. Check the assumptions.\n\nVariable types\nQuestions 5a: What are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables?\nMissing data\n\nRemove participants with missing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the filter() function and the is.na() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\ndat &lt;- dat %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(VapingQuestionnaireScore)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(IAT_RT))\n\n\n\nQuestion 5b How many people had missing data?\nNormality\n\nCreate histograms and qq-plots for the IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the ggplot() function with geom_histogram() and use the qqPlot() function (note the capital P).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nggplot(dat, aes(x = VapingQuestionnaireScore)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nqqPlot(x = dat$VapingQuestionnaireScore)\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = IAT_RT)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nqqPlot(x = dat$IAT_RT)\n\n\n\nQuestion 5c What do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed?\nLinearity and homoscedasticity\n\nPlot the relationship between IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore using a scatterplot and a line of best fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this you’ll need the ggplot() function together with geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = IAT_RT, y = VapingQuestionnaireScore)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Implicit attitude\", y = \"Explicit attitude\")\n\n\n\nQuestion 5d What do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship? What does the scatterplot tell you about possible issues (outliers, range restrictions)?\n\nStep 6. Conduct a correlation analysis.\n\nQuestion 6a Do you need to calculate Pearson’s r or Spearman’s rho? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the cor.test() function. You may want to use the pull() and the round() functions to get the numbers out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nresults &lt;- cor.test(dat$VapingQuestionnaireScore, \n                    dat$IAT_RT, \n                    method = \"pearson\") %&gt;% \n  tidy()\n\nresults\n\ncorrelation &lt;- results %&gt;% \n  pull(estimate) %&gt;%\n  round(2)\n\ndf &lt;- results %&gt;% \n  pull(parameter) %&gt;%\n  round(0)\n\npvalue &lt;- results %&gt;% \n  pull(p.value) %&gt;%\n  round(3)\n\n\n\nQuestion 6b Is the correlation significant?\n\nStep 7. Write a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines. Make sure to include the r, df, p-value and an interpretation.\n\n\nStep 8. Intercorrelations. Finally, let’s check whether either implicit or explicit attitude is associated with age. First, let’s create a new data frame that only includes the relevant variables. Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Don’t forget to copy the code below to your script and run it.\n\n\ndat_matrix &lt;- dat %&gt;%\n  select(Age, IAT_RT, VapingQuestionnaireScore) %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() # Make sure tell R that dat is a data frame\n\n\nNow, create a matrix of scatterplots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the pairs() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs(dat_matrix)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8a What do you conclude from the scatterplots?\n\nFinally, conduct intercorrelation (multiple correlations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the correlate() function. Do you need Pearson’s r or Spearman’s rho?

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\n\nLab activity 1\n\nCorrelation would be an appropriate form on analysis for researchers interested in the relationship between\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDog (breed) and height (cm) of owner\nSpeed of swimming (mph) and area of tank (cm)\nNumber of cows sitting and rain fall (mm)\nTotal llama saliva (ml) expelled and gender of visitors\nb and d\n\nf. b and c All variables in b anc c are continuous. Dog breed and gender are categorical.\n\n\n\n\nWhen would you use Spearman’s rho analysis instead of Pearson’s r?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nb. When the data is not normally distributed\n\n\n\n\nUsing the histograms and qq-plots below, which of these variables satisfies the normality assumption? Explain your answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nVocabulary. Only for vocabulary does the histogram resemble a bell curve and do the data-points in the qq-plot fall within the dashed blue lines.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should correlation analysis not be conducted on variables with a curvilinear relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nMay be subject to a type 2 error - there actually is a relationship between variables yet we reject the null hypothesis. As the relationship is not linear, correlation analysis will not identify this.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 2\nYou can download the R-Markdown script that contains the code to complete lab activity 2 here: 122_wk12_labAct2.R.\nQuestion 2a. For how many participants do we have data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 166 observations, so we have data for 166 participants. You can see this in the Environment window in the top right. This does not tell us whether any of these participants have any missing data.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3a. For how many participants do we have data now that we have cleaned them up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n104 participants\n\n\n\nQuestion 3b. Use the information in the background description to understand how the scores relate to attitudes. What does a positive IAT_RT score reflect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with a positive IAT_RT are considered to hold the implicit view that vaping is negative (i.e. congruent associations are quicker than incongruent associations).\n\n\n\nWhat does a negative IAT_RT score reflect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with a negative IAT_RT are considered to hold the implicit view that vaping is positive (i.e. incongruent associations were quicker than congruent associations). :::\nWhat does a higher score on the ‘VapingQuestionnaireScore’ mean?\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=“true”} ## Answer ::: Higher scores indicated a positive explicit attitude towards vaping. :::\nQuestion 4a. Why might these averages be useful? Why are averages not always useful in correlations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is always worth thinking about which averages are informative and which are not. Knowing the average explicit attitude towards vaping could well be informative. In contrast, if you are using an ordinal scale and people use the whole of the scale then the average may just tell you the middle of the scale you are using - which you already know and really isn’t that informative. So it is always worth thinking about what your descriptives are calculating.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5a. What are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth can be considered continuous variables and at least at interval level.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5b. How many people had missing data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we removed participants with missing data, we had 104 observations, now we have 96. So there must have been 8 participants without a score on one or the other variable.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5c. What do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Both histograms resemble a normal distribution (bell curve) and the open circles in the qq-plots fall within the blue stripy lines.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5d. What do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship? What does the scatterplot tell you about possible issues (outliers, range restrictions)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data look like a cloud without a clear direction. This suggests the relationship might might be weak. In terms of linearity, the scatterplot doesn’t suggest any curvilinear relationships. Variance seems quite constant, but there do seem to be few people with negative IAT_RT (Implicit attitude) scores, suggesting few people held the view that vaping is positive.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6a. Do you need to calculate Pearson’s r or Spearman’s rho?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nPearson’s r because the data do meet the assumptions.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6b. Is the correlation significant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, p = .822, which is larger than .05.\n\n\n\nWrite a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines. Make sure to include the r, df, p-value and an interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the hypothesis of a relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping, a Pearson correlation found no significant relationship between IAT reaction times (implicit attitude) and answers on a Vaping Questionnaire (explicit attitude), r(94) = -.02, p = .822. Overall this suggests that there is no direct relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes with regard to vaping and as such our hypothesis was not supported; we cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\nQuestion 8a. What do you conclude from the scatterplots?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplots with age suggest that age is highly skewed with only a few participants older than 25. For now, let’s say we’ll therefore calculate Spearman’s rho, rather than Pearson’s r. That is ok for now, but if you were analysing these data for a research project, you’d want to have a closer look at the age variable (think histogram, qq-plot, and think about either collecting more data from older participants or transforming the variable (more about that next year).\n\n\n\nQuestion 8b. What do you conclude from the results of the correlation analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNo significant correlation with age was found."

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook sections you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Visualing correlations\nHave a look at this visualisation of correlations by Kristoffer Magnusson.\nAfter having read the relevant sections of Howell (2017) Chapter 9, use this visualisation page to visually replicate the scatterplots in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 - use a sample of 100. After that, visually replicate the scatterplots in Figure 9.3.\nEach time you change the correlation, pay attention to the shared variance (the overlap between the two variables) and see how this changes with the changing level of relationship between the two variables. The greater the shared variance, the stronger the relationship.\nAlso, try setting the correlation to r = .5 and then moving a single dot to see how one data point, a potential outlier, can change the stated correlation value between two variables.\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Guess the correlation\nNow that you are well versed in interpreting scatterplots (scattergrams) have a go at this online app on guessing the correlation.\nThis is a very basic app that allows you to see how good you are at recognising different correlation strengths from the scatterplots. We would recommend you click the “Track Performance” tab so you can keep an overview of your overall bias to underestimate or overestimate a correlation.\nIs this all just a bit of fun? Well, yes, because stats is actually fun, and no, because it serves a purpose of helping you determine if the correlations you see in your own data are real, and to help you see if correlations in published research match with what you are being told. As you will have seen from the above examples, one data point can lead to a misleading relationship and even what might be considered a medium to strong relationship may actually have only limited relevance in the real world. One only needs to mention Anscombe’s Quartet to be reminded of the importance of visualising your data, which leads us to the final pre-lab activity for this week.\n\n\nPre-lab activity 3: Anscombe’s quartet\nAnscombe (1973) showed that four sets of bivariate data (X, Y) that have the exact same means, medians, and relationships can look very different when plotted. You can read more about this here.\nAll in this is a clear example of why you should visualise your data and not to rely on just the numbers.\n\n\nPre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nRemind yourself of the basics of how to work with RStudio and get your files ready\nYou might want to re-visit the materials that John and Tom provided in PSYC121:\n\nBasics of working with RStudio\nCreate a folder for Week 11.\nDownload the 122_week11_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created at the previous step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below.\n\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week11/122_week11_forStudents/exams.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"exams.csv\")"

Now, let’s look at the correlation between number of minutes per week spent reading in the home and watching TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the datafile (“MillerHadenData.csv”). Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo this if you couldn’t upload files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week11/MillerHadenData.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"MillerHadenData.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew R Markdown script\n\n\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you have started a new R Markdown script. If you need a reminder of how to do that, please revisit week 6 of PSYC121 (here).\n\n\n\nStep 1. Add the code to load the broom and the tidyverse libraries in a new code chunk. If you are unsure, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library()function. Remember to put it inside a ‘code chunk’ in your R Markdown script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Read in the data. You should now see a dataframe with 25 observations and 5 variables in the ‘Environment’. Click on it to view it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv()function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nmh &lt;- read_csv(\"MillerHadenData.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Construct a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘Home’ and ‘TV’. Also add a line of best fit and make sure you use clear labels for your axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the ggplot()function in combination with geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Make sure you use clear labels for your axes by using labs().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a template of the code, make sure to add the data frame and the relevant variable names. Also add clear labels for your axes.\nggplot(DATA, aes(x = , y = )) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nggplot(mh, aes(x = Home, y = TV)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Time spend reading at home\", y = \"Time spend watching TV at home\")\n\n\n\nQuestion 3a: What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship? Write a few sentences in your R Markdown script to describe the relationship.\n\nStep 4. Conduct the correlation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the cor.test()function in combination with tidy().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a template of the code, make sure to add the data frame and the relevant variables names.\nresults &lt;- cor.test(DATA$X, \n                    DATA$Y, \n                    method = \"pearson\", \n                    alternative = \"two.sided\") %&gt;% \n  tidy()\nresults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nresults &lt;- cor.test(mh$Home, \n                    mh$TV, \n                    method = \"pearson\", \n                    alternative = \"two.sided\") %&gt;% \n  tidy()\nresults\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve run this code chunk, the output should appear in your R Markdown script and you can answer the questions below using that output. You can also pull out the different pieces of information by using the pull() function and round the values using the round() function, like this:\nr &lt;- results %&gt;%\n  pull(estimate) %&gt;%\n  round(2)\nQuestion 4a: What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)?\nQuestion 4b: What is the p value?\nQuestion 4c: Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level?\nQuestion 4d: What are the degrees of freedom you need to report?\n\nStep 5. Calculate how much variance in ‘time spent reading’ can be accounted for by ‘time spent watching TV’?\n\nAs discussed in the theory lecture, this is referred to as the ‘coefficient of determination’ or ‘R-squared’. To calculate it, you square the value for Pearson’s r. To calculate how much variance in one variable is accounted for by the other variable, you multiply it by 100 and round it to 0 decimals.\n\nStep 6. Write a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines.\n\n\n\nLab activity 3: Hazardous alcohol use and impulsivity\nResearchers were interested in the relationship between hazardous alcohol use and impulsivity (making unplanned, rapid decisions without thinking or ‘acting on a whim’). To investigate the relationship, 20 participants completed both the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1993) and Barratt’s Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we begin\n\n\n\nAssuming you are using the same R Markdown script as for the previous lab activity, you should already have code to load the broom and the tidyverse libraries. If this is a new session, you just need to re-run that code chunk to ensure they are loaded. At this point, it is a good idea to clear your environment to avoid any confusion between data frames or values. You can do this by clicking on the broom icon on the top right of the Environment pane. The data file (“alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv”) is in the folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’. As long as that folder is set as your working directory, you are good to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo this if you couldn’t upload files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week11/122_week11_forStudents/alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv\")\n\n\nStep 1. Read in the data. You should now see an object containing the data in the ‘Environment’.\n\nQuestion 1a: How many variables does it have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv()function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Plot the relationship between hazard alcohol use and impulsivity using a scatterplot and a line of best fit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the ggplot()function in combination with geom_point() and geom_smooth().

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at code written by someone else…\n\n\nLab activity 1: Interpreting correlation\n\nBelow are scatterplots that show the relationship between ‘how much you know about correlation and how attractive you appear to members of the opposite (&/or same) sex’. Choose the type of correlation (strength and direction) displayed in each graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrong positive correlation\nnull correlation\nmoderate positive correlation\nperfect negative correlation\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose it was observed that there is a correlation of r = -.81 between a driver’s age and the cost of car insurance. This correlation would mean that, in general, older people pay more for car insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFALSE Explanation: The correlation coefficient is negative and therefore infers a negative correlation. As such, older people pay less for car insurance: as age increases, car insurance costs decrease.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that there is a correlation of r = .87 between the length of time a person is in prison and the amount of aggression the person displays on a psychological inventory administered at release. This means that spending a longer amount of time in prison causes people to become more aggressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nFALSE Explanation: This is a bit of trick question as it has the sneaky ‘cause’ word in. The correlation coefficient is a positive number, suggesting a positive relationship between length of time in prison and aggression. However, causation cannot be inferred from correlation and therefore we cannot know whether time spent in prison CAUSES aggression, and rather we suggest a relationship between the two: as length of time in prison increases, aggression increases.\n\n\n\n\nA significant correlation was found between having great hair and performance in correlation labs. The correlation coefficient was .7. How much variance in correlation lab performance can the ‘greatness’ of your hair explain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nc 49% The ‘coefficient of determination’ or ‘R-squared’ tells us the proportion or variance in one variable that can be predicted if we know the other variable. We can determine this by squaring the r. Therefore, .72 = .49, R2 = .49.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 2: Constructing scatterplots and calculating correlations\nYou can download the RMd-script that contains the code to complete lab activities 2 and 3 here: 122_wk11_labActivities2_3.Rmd.\nQuestion 3a: What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a negative association between ‘Home’ and ‘TV’. This means that the longer a child spends watching TV, the shorter they will read at home.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4a: What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nr = -.65\n\n\n\nQuestion 4b: What is the p value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt; .001\n\n\n\nQuestion 4c: Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, because the p-value is smaller than .005\n\n\n\nQuestion 4d: What are the degrees of freedom you need to report?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\nStep 5. How much variance in ‘time spent reading’ can be accounted for by ‘time spent watching TV’?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n42%\n\n\n\nStep 6. Write a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething along the lines of: A Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between time spent reading at home and time spent watching TV at home. There was a significant negative correlation, r(23) = -.65, p &lt; .001. As time spent watching TV increased, time spent reading at home decreased.\n\n\n\n\n\nLab activity 3: Hazardous alcohol use and impulsivity\nQuestion 1a: How many variables does it have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nQuestion 2a: What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a positive association between ‘hazardous alcohol use’ and ‘impulsivity’. This means that as a participant’s score on ‘hazardous alcohol use’ goes up, their score on ‘impulsivity’ also goes up.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3a: What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nr = .54\n\n\n\nQuestion 3b: What is the p value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\np = .014\n\n\n\nQuestion 3c: Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\nQuestion 3d: What are the degrees of freedom you need to report?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nQuestion 3e: How much variance in ‘impulsivity’ can be accounted for by ‘hazardous alcohol use’?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n29%\n\n\n\nQuestion 3f:. Give three logically possible directions of causality, indicating for each direction whether it is a plausible explanation in light of the variables involved (and why). No, this is not a trick question —-I know that correlation does not infer causation, but think critically! New studies/ideas are constructed by thinking what the previous study doesn’t tell us about what could be happening with the variables of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nJust really looking for reasoning here.\nExamples:\n\nBeing more impulsive may make people consume more alcohol.\nConsuming more alcohol may make people more impulsive.\nAn outgoing personality might influence both your level of impulsivity and you are more likely to be socialising in the pub and consuming alcohol. So the same ‘third factor’ may influence both our variables of interest.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Write a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething along the lines of: A Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between alcohol use and impulsivity. There was a significant positive correlation, r(18) = .54, p &lt; .014. People who reported to consume more alcohol, scored higher on the impulsivity scale."
