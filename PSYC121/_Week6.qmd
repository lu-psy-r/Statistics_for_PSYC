## Reading 

[Chapter 8](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=2017199) of Howell

## Pre-lab work

-   Ensure you have watched the lecture for Week 6.

-   There is a learnr tutorial to complete which will help you to think about **binomial tests**. [You can find it here](https://ma-rconnect.lancs.ac.uk/PSYC121_2022_W6_prep/){target="_blank"}.

-   Set up a new folder in RStudio and upload the files from the [Week 6 zip file](data/Week_6/Week_6.zip)

-   If you create a folder and upload the file into RStudio before the lab class you'll be even more ready to follow along!

## Some basic RMarkdown

We introduced you to RMarkdown in Week 4. It's like a .R script, only a bit more fancy! Today we'll introduce a couple more features and use this in our tasks below. 

1. Make sure you have a Week 6 folder

2. Once in that folder in the files pane, click "more" and "set as working directory"

3. Then click the new file button and select "R Markdown"

![](images/wk6/new_rmd.png) 
4. You'll be asked to name this file. Leave the other options as they are and click OK.

5. When the new R Markdown file appears, try "knitting" it (the icon at the top with the ball of wool). You should get a nice output of the default R Markdown document.

6. Note that in R Markdown documents you can freely type in text in the main body of the file - you did this last week. But see how you can also create a *"code chunk"* within the document. These are places where you put your R code you want to run. In a way, R Markdown files function in the opposite way to .R files: you write normal text in the main part (like you'd do in a word processor), but you create a special bit for your code; in a .R file you write code, and use the "#" to say when you want to write normal text. 

7. Try running the first code chunk (click the green arrow on the right). This will run the code and display the output (in the document and in the console). 


## Creating an R Markdown for your lab work

1. Delete all of the script except the first title (## R Markdown)

2. Change this title to something more relevant: (e.g., ## Task 1 - Card Sampling task)

3. Knit your document to check it is still working!

## Card sampling task

![](images/wk6/cards.jpg)

In the first task this week we will look at the sampling of events and we will apply the basic statistical test of the binomial test: `binom.test()`

Each table has a set of cards. These will be 13 red cards and 13 black cards - please check your set to ensure you have the right number of each colour (it doesn't matter what suit the cards are).

We are going to play a game in which one person chooses a set of these cards and biases the deck towards either red or black. The other members of the table have to try and work out which way the set is biased. To do this, they will draw samples from the deck.

Think of this as an experiment: there is something real out there in the world in our "population" (the cards). As an experimenter we are trying to estimate what is true about the world, and in order to do this we need to take samples. When you can only see the backs of the cards, that data is unobserved. But as we draw samples, we start to understand how the "world" is - whether it is biased towards red or black. 

So each time you draw a card, you are observing one data point from the population, and based on the data you collect (your samples) you are going to draw an inference about what is true about the population.

### Set up and instructions:

1.  One person on each table should act as the "world" (the person who biases the cards). Congratulations, you are God! This person will determine what is true about the state of things in the world. This means they control what is contained in the deck of cards. 
2. For each experiment, this person secretly looks at the cards, and removes some cards to use in the experiment. For example, from the set of 26 cards, they might choose to remove 4 black cards. The deck is now biased towards red (13 red; 9 black).

3. It's important that no one sees what the cards are (the ones you've kept, or the ones removed). Shuffle the cards so they are ready to be sampled. 

4.  The remaining people (1 or more) will act as the experimenters. Your job is to draw samples and work out whether you think the deck is biased or not towards either red or black. 

5. Now copy the following text and code to your R Markdown document to record your work:

````
### Experiment 1

Number of samples:
Total red cards found:
Total black cards found:
Conclusion: 
The true bias was: 


```{{r}}

binom.test(x, n) # x is the number or red or black; n is the sample size

```

````
### Running each experiment 

Do these steps for each experiment:

1. The "World" removes some cards from the full deck (the number and colour of the cards removed is up to them). They shuffle the chosen cards ready to start the "experiment".

2. The "Experimenters" **pre-register** their sample size. That is, they state how many cards they are going to draw.

3. Draw samples one at a time. Importantly - make sure you replace the cards each time and the world/dealer should give the pack a quick shuffle. 

4. Do step 3 until you have collect the sample size you chose

5. Once you have all the samples, the experimenters should draw a conclusion based initially on their own "gut feeling" about the data. Do you think the deck was biased towards red, black, or was it unbiased?

6. Change the `binom.test()` code to provide a statistical result. Note the "p value". Was this result unusual? How likely were the data given the null hypothesis? Note down the p value that this test gives you.

7. The "world" can then reveal the hidden cards. Was the deck actually biased or not? How does this sit with a) your initial conclusions, and b) the result of the binomial test? Feel free to Write a short statement about what you found in this experiment. 

Repeat all of the above steps (1-5) for a new experiment, **making sure that you try different parameters for the experiment**. So vary a) how many cards are removed from the deck, b) the combination of cards removed from the deck, and c) the pre-registered sample size. Feel free to swap the roles around.

Once you've conducted a few experiments, discuss on your table the results you found. It might be useful to think about the following things:

-   were there times when your intuitions were different to the statistical result? For example, you were sure there was a bias, but in fact the statistics told you this was not that unusual (p was \> .05)?

-   were there times when the deck was actually biased, but you failed to prove this with your experiment (you failed to see p \< .05)? Do you remember what this type of error is called?

-   were there times when the deck was *not* biased, but the test result suggested it was (p \< .05)? Do you remember what type of error this is called?

## RStudio tasks

For the second exercise today we will take a look at the phone data again. If you haven't already, set up a new folder for Week 6 and upload the data from the Week 6 zip (see pre-lab instructions).

### Read in the csv data file

You should know how to do this by now. But if not, try searching "csv" at the top. Remember that what you name your data set is important for the following commands.

### Take a look at the data

There are lots of ways to get a quick look at the data. Here are a few useful ones (some you've come across, some that might be new): `glimpse()`, `summary()`, `View()`, `head()`.

### Create a boxplot of the phone data

Complete the code to create a boxplot of the estimated phone use. Note that you can put the boxes on either the x or you y axis. Copy and paste the code and edit it so you can also plot the actual phone use.

### Create a density plot and/or histogram of the phone data

It's very easy to convert the boxplot code into either a density plot (`geom_density()`) or a histogram (`geom_histogram()`). Have a play around with these different types of graphs. Which one communicates the spread of the data most clearly? Is it better to plot these on the x or y axis?

### Plot the relationship between estimated and actual phone use

So far we've looked at the phone use estimate and the actual phone use separately. But if people are at all accurate in their estimates, we'd expect these two things to be related (those people who use their phone more probably know they do). Let's use a scatter plot to see if this relationship exists in our data. In `ggplot()` we can do with with `geom_point()`. Each point on the graph needs an x and y value, so with the code you've been given, you just need to add in the two variables we want to plot.

-   Is there a relationship between these variables?
-   How would you describe this relationship in words?

### Binomial test of the accuracy of phone use estimates

So did people overestimate or underestimate their phone use on average? We have given you a column called *accuracy* which simply says whether each participant underestimated or overestimated. Add your dataset name to this code to use the `count()` function to get the total who overestimated and underestimated. With these totals, you have enough information to run a binomial test:

-   for this test focus on the totals for "underestimate" and "overestimate" (for simplicity we can ignore people who were "accurate" and the NA values)
-   These give you your first two parameters for `binom.test()`
-   to get the probability, we consider the null hypothesis
-   that is what's the probability of overestimating or underestimating under the null hypothesis?
-   what is the result of the binomial test?
-   You can also include the *UK_region* within your count, and then run binomial tests on these sub-groups. Do you find any interesting reuslts? What issues might we have with running the `binom.test()` on these sub groups?

### More things to try with your scatter plot

We can customise our plot even further:

-   Try adding/changing the `size =` within `geom_point()` to make the points bigger or smaller (values from .1 to 30)
-   Try adding/changing the `alpha =` within `geom_point()` to make the points transparent (try values between 0.1 and 1)
-   try adding `colour =` within `ggplot(aes( ))` to *map* the colour to the 'UK_region' variable.
-   you can change the colours used by ggplot by adding `+ scale_colour_brewer()` to your plot code. Within this, try setting the pallete parameter to one of these options (e.g., `scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set3")`)

![](images/wk6/brewer_cols.png)

-   remember you can add labels using `+labs()`
-   remember you can set a new theme, such as `+ theme_minimal()`
