What person attributes predict success in understanding?\n\nIn psychological science, research questions like our question can be examined **using linear models**.\n:::\n\nWhen we do these analyses, we will need to think about how we report the results:  \n\n- we usually need to report information about the kind of model we specify;\n- and we will need to report the nature of the association estimated in our model.\n\nThis means we will usually need to decide:\n\n- is the association significant?\n- does the association reflect a positive or negative relationship between outcome and predictor?\n- is the association relatively strong or weak?\n\nOur thinking, and our decision-making, will be helped by developing our data visualization skills.\nAt every stage, as we work, we will visualize the data to:\n\n- Understand the shape of the relationships we may observe or predict.\n\n::: callout-tip\n- We will aim to build skills in producing professional-looking plots for our audiences. \n:::\n\n## Lectures {#sec-wk17-lectures}\n\n::: callout-tip\nBefore you go on to the activities in @sec-wk17-lab-activities, **watch** the lectures:\n:::\n\nThe lecture for this week is presented in four short parts.\nYou can view video recordings of the lectures using Panopto, by clicking on the links shown following.\n\n1. **Overview** (19 minutes): What we are doing in Week 17 -- thinking critically about predicting people.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=5c751906-33d0-4ebd-a49d-afb000ec09ce&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n2. **Using linear models to do prediction** (11 minutes): How we answer live research questions by using linear models to predict behaviour.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=d9d5ade2-e10c-4e14-b938-afb000f2634c&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n3. **How linear models work** (9 minutes): How we can visualize and think about predictions, and about the difference between what we predict and what we observe when we study people.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=44dfb2c3-80d3-4fa6-8978-afb000f63c17&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n4. **Interpreting, reporting and visualizing** linear model results (15 minutes): Identifying, interpreting and communicating the key statistics.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=4a20cb70-618c-4bf3-999a-afb000f9bdcf&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded either as a web page or as a Word document.\n:::\n\n- [The slides](data/week17/122-linear-model-intro.html) exactly as presented (21 MB). \n- [The slides](data/week17/122-linear-model-intro-printable-edit.docx) converted to a Word .docx (11 MB). \n\nYou can download the web page `.html` file and click on it to open it in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge or Safari). The slide images are high quality so the file is quite big and may take a few seconds to download.\n\nYou can download the `.docx` file and click on it to open it as a Word document that you can then edit. \nConverting the slides to a .docx distorts some images but the benefit of the conversion is that it makes it easier for you to add your notes.\n\n### The lectures have two main areas of focus {#sec-wk17-lectures-focus}\n\n**1. Understanding the scientific process**\n\nI outline the steps through which a psychological scientist may progress, in logic and practice, from research questions to hypotheses to analyses.\n\nWe are learning data analysis methods.\nBut the key point is that we use these methods in the context of a research project with concerns, aims, methodological assumptions, and choices.\nThis is generally true so the aim is to present a concrete example of how research works.\n\nAs part of the discussion, I raise questions you might want to consider.\nThese questions are also part of the context for our data analysis, because they help to inform how you interpret or evaluate the results.\nThese questions are examples of the **critical evaluation** that you will need to develop through your studies.\n\n**2. The linear model**\n\nWe look at how the linear model can be used to address research questions in the context of the **Clearly understood** health comprehension project.\nBut I aim to outline some general ideas about why we use the linear model technique, and how it works.\n\nI build on work you have done with Margriet Groen in earlier PSYC122 classes, so that we can *strengthen* understanding, and *extend skills*.\n\nThe lectures end with a discussion of the critical information you must identify and extract when you view the summary of a linear model results.\n\nI then show you how to report the results.\nI give you examples of the conventional language you can use to report your results.\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo work with the recordings:\n\n- Watch the video parts right through.\n- Use the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\n- Try out the coding exercises in the how-to guide and the acitivity tasks or questions (@sec-wk17-lab-activities) to learn how to construct visualizations and do analyses.\n:::\n\n## Reading: Links to other classes\n\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\n- The lectures in *PSYC123* on: the scientific method; reliability and validity; experimental design, especially between-subjects studies; hypothesis testing; and precise hypotheses.\n- The lecture in *PSYC122* on correlations. \n\n## Pre-lab activities {#sec-wk17-prelab-activities}\n\n### Pre-lab activity 1 {#sec-wk17-prelab-activities-1}\n\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\n\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from *PSYC122* students: **you**.\n\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\n\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link [here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0qdj8TOZc18LR0q)\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n:::\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.\n\nTaking part in the survey is **completely voluntary**.\nYou can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it.\nIf you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).\n\nAll responses will be recorded completely anonymously.\n\n### Pre-lab activity alternative option {#sec-wk17-prelab-activities-2}\n\nIf you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.\n\n[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)\n\n## Lab activities {#sec-wk17-lab-activities}\n\n### Introduction {#sec-wk17-lab-activities-1-introduction}\n\nWe will do our practical lab work to develop your skills in the context of the **Clearly Understood** project.\n\n- Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions:\n\n1.

next) in the `how-to` guide.\n\n- Start by looking at the `how-to` guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.\n:::\n\nWe will take things *step-by-step*.\n\nWe split .Rmd scripts by steps, tasks and questions:\n\n- different steps for different phases of the analysis workflow;\n- different tasks for different things you need to do;\n- different questions to examine different ideas or coding challenges\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Make sure you start at the top of the `.Rmd` file and work your way, in order, through each task.\n- Complete each task before you move on to the next task.\n:::\n\nIn the activity @sec-wk17-lab-activities-2, we are going to work through the following tasks.\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Notice that we are gradually building up our skills: consolidating what we know; revising important learning; and extending ourselves to acquire new skills.\n- Over time, we will refer less and less to what we have learned before.\n:::\n\n**Step 1: Set-up**\n\n1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`\n2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`\n\n**Step 2: Load the data**\n\n3. Read in the data file -- using `read_csv()`\n4. Inspect the data -- using `head()` and `summary()`\n\n**Step 3: Use histograms to examine the distributions of variables**\n\n5. Draw histograms to examine the distributions of variables -- using `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`\n6. Practice editing the appearance of a histogram plot step-by-step\n\n**Step 4: Now draw scatterplots to examine associations between variables**\n\n7. Create scatterplots to examine the association between some variables \n8. Edit the appearance of *each* plot step-by-step\n\n**Step 5: Use correlation to to answer the research questions **\n\n9. Examine the correlations between the outcome variable and predictor variables\n\n**Step 6: Use a linear model to to answer the research questions**\n\n10. Examine the relation between outcome mean accuracy (`mean.acc`) and each of the potential predictors: `SHIPLEY`, `HLVA` and `AGE`\n\n**Step 7: Use a linear model to generate predictions**\n\n11. Use a model we have fitted to plot model predictions\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, look at the advice in `2023-24-PSYC122-w17-how-to.Rmd` on how to do the tasks, with examples on how to write the code.\n:::\n\nYou will see that you can match a task in the activity @sec-wk17-lab-activities-2 to the same task in the `how-to` guide.\nThe `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.\n\nThis process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in modern psychological science.\n\n::: callout-warning\nDon't forget: You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.\n:::\n\n### Lab activity 2 {#sec-wk17-lab-activities-2}\n\n### OK: now let's do it!\n\nIn the following, we will guide you through the tasks and questions step by step.\nYou will learn more if you follow this advice:\n\n::: callout-tip\n1. We will hide the code to do some tasks behind a drop-down button. Try to write and run the code for yourself first.\n2. We won't always give you the code required to do something: this gives you the chance to check what you have learned by trying out your code without the answer in front of you.\n3.

See ggplot reference information on adding lines here:\n\n<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html>\n:::\n\nOne of our research questions is:\n\n1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?\n\nExamine the correlations between the outcome variable and predictor variables.\n\nYou need to run three separate correlations:\n\n1. between mean accuracy and `SHIPLEY`;\n2. between mean accuracy and `HLVA`;\n3. between mean accuracy and `AGE`.\n\nCheck out the example code for doing each of the correlation analyses.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-29_aad47375c0865a1180bf940b196fabb5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor.test(study.two.gen$SHIPLEY, study.two.gen$mean.acc, method = \"pearson\",  alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\ncor.test(study.two.gen$HLVA, study.two.gen$mean.acc, method = \"pearson\",  alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\ncor.test(study.two.gen$AGE, study.two.gen$mean.acc, method = \"pearson\",  alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow use the results from the correlations to answer the following questions.\n\n>**Q.12.** What is `r`, the coefficient for the correlation between `mean.acc` and `SHIPLEY`?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.12. r = 0.4650537\n:::\n\n>**Q.13.** Is the correlation between `mean.acc` and `HLVA`  significant?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.13. -- r is significant, p < .05\n:::\n\n>**Q.14.** What are the values for t and p for the significance test for the correlation between `mean.acc` and `AGE`?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.14. t = 0.30121, p = 0.7636\n:::\n\n>**Q.15.** For which pair of outcome-predictor variables is the correlation the largest?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.15. -- The correlation is the largest between `mean.acc` and `HLVA`.\n:::\n\n>**Q.16.** What is the sign or direction of each of the correlations?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.16. -- All the correlations are positive.\n:::\n\nExamine the relation between outcome mean accuracy (`mean.acc`) and each of the predictors: `SHIPLEY`, `HLVA` and `AGE`\n\nYou need to run three separate `lm()` analyses:\n\n1. with mean accuracy as the outcome and `SHIPLEY` as the predictor;\n2. with mean accuracy as the outcome and `HLVA` as the predictor;\n3. with mean accuracy as the outcome and `AGE` as the predictor.\n\nCheck out the example code for each of the models.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-30_b224c117975e977a69297a10fb0396cb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel.1 <- lm(mean.acc ~ SHIPLEY, data = study.two.gen)\nsummary(model.1)\n\nmodel.2 <- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = study.two.gen)\nsummary(model.2)\n\nmodel.3 <- lm(mean.acc ~ AGE, data = study.two.gen)\nsummary(model.3)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you look at the model summary you can answer the following questions.\n\n>**Q.17.** What is the estimate for the coefficient of the effect of the predictor `HLVA` on `mean.acc`?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.17. 0.026207\n:::\n\n>**Q.18.** Is the effect significant?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.18. It is significant, p < .05\n:::\n\n>**Q.19.** What are the values for t and p for the significance test for the coefficient?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.19. t = 7.529, p = 2.87e-12\n:::\n\n>**Q.20.** How would you describe in words the shape or direction of the association between `HLVA` and `mean.acc`?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.20. The slope coefficient -- and a scatterplot (draw it) -- suggest that as HLVA scores increase so also do mean accuracy scores.\n:::\n\n>**Q.21.** How how would you describe the relations apparent between the predictor and outcome in all three models?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.21. It is possible to see, given coefficient estimates, that the association between predictor and outcome is positive for each model: mean accuracy appears to increase for increasing values of SHIPLEY vocabulary, HLVA health literacy, and age.\n:::\n\nWe are going to draw a scatterplot and add a line.\n\n- The line will show the model predictions, given the model intercept and effect\ncoefficient estimates.\n\n**First fit a model** and get the summary: model the relationship between `mean.acc` and `HLVA`.\n\nYou will need to record some information from the model summary so you can use it next.\n\n>**Q.22.** What is the coefficient estimate for the intercept?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.22. 0.522016\n:::\n\n>**Q.23.** What is the coefficient estimate for the slope of `HLVA` (see earlier)?\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n- A.23. 0.026207\n:::\n\n## Online Q&A {#sec-wk17-lab-Q-and-A}\n\nYou will find, below, a link to the video recording of the Week 17 online Q&A after it has been completed.\n\n\n```{=html}\n```\n",
