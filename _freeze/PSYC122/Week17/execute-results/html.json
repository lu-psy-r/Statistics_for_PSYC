Linear Models\nsubtitle: Written by Rob Davies\norder: 8\n---\n\n## PSYC122 *Part 2* Week 17 {#sec-week-17-intro}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWelcome to your overview of the materials you will work with in **PSYC122 Week 17**.\n\nWe will complete four classes in weeks 16-19.\nThese classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.\n\nWe will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the **Clearly understood** project.\n\n- Our focus will be on **what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information**.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn the week 17 class, we will aim to answer the research question:\n\n1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?\n:::\n\n## Our learning goals\n\nIn Week 17, we aim to further develop skills in *analyzing* and in *visualizing* psychological data.\n\n::: callout-tip\n- In psychological science, research questions like our question can be examined using linear models.\n:::\n\nWhen we do these analyses, we will need to think about how we report the results:  \n\n- we usually need to report information about the kind of model we specify;\n- we will need to report the nature of the association estimated in our model;\n- and we usually need to decide, is the association significant?\n- does the association reflect a positive or negative relationship between outcome and predictor?\n- is the association we see in our sample data relatively strong or weak?\n\n::: callout-tip\n- We will aim to build skills in producing professional-looking plots for our audiences. \n:::\n\nAt every stage, as we work, we will visualize the data to:\n\n- Understand the shape of the relationships we may observe or predict.\n\n## Your resources {#sec-w17-resources-intro}\n\nYou will see -- below -- links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities.\n\nAll the links to the lectures, and everything you need for your practical work class can *also* be found under the **Week 17 resources** section title, on Moodle:\n\n[Link to Moodle](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38180#section-10)\n\n## Lectures: video recordings\n\nThe lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts.\n\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the *Panopto* video for the lecture part.\n(You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)\n\n[Part 1 of 4; about 19 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5c751906-33d0-4ebd-a49d-afb000ec09ce)\n\n[Part 2 of 4; about 11 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d9d5ade2-e10c-4e14-b938-afb000f2634c)\n\n[Part 3 of 4; about 9 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=44dfb2c3-80d3-4fa6-8978-afb000f63c17)\n\n[Part 4 of 4; about 15 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4a20cb70-618c-4bf3-999a-afb000f9bdcf)\n\nThe lectures have two main areas of focus.\n\n**1. Understanding the scientific process**\n\nI outline the steps through which a psychological scientist may progress, in logic and practice, from research questions to hypotheses to analyses.\n\nI rehearse some of the key points I have discussed, previously, in order to build a framework in which you can understand how we go from:\n\n- a set of concerns -- here: *What makes it easy or difficult to understand written health information?* \n- through choices about what data to collect, and how\n- to specific questions, and then predictions\n- that we can test using linear models.\n\nWe are learning data analysis methods.\nBut the key point is that we use these methods in the context of a research project with concerns, aims, methodological assumptions, and choices.\nThis is generally true so the aim is to present a concrete example of how research works.\n\nAs part of the discussion, I raise questions you might want to consider.\nThese questions -- and questions you can originate for yourselves -- are also part of the context for our data analysis, because they help to inform how you interpret or evaluate the results.\nThese questions are examples of the **critical evaluation** that you will need to develop through your studies.\n\n**2. The linear model**\n\nWe look at how the linear model can be used to address research questions in the context of the **Clearly understood** health comprehension project.\nBut I aim to outline some general ideas about why we use the linear model technique, and how it works.\nI build on work you have done with Margriet Groen in earlier PSYC122 classes, so that we can *strengthen* understanding, and *extend skills*.\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo work with the recordings:\n\n- Watch the video parts right through.\n- Use the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\n- Try out the coding exercises in the how-to and the workbook (see @sec-w17-resources) to see for yourself how you can construct visualizations and do analyses.\n:::\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how we use the linear model to estimate the association between (1.) an outcome like mean accuracy of understanding and (2.) a predictor like vocabulary knowledge: estimating the association as the *expected change* in the *average outcome* given variation in the predictor.\n\nIn the plot on the right of @fig-ridges, we show the distribution curve of mean (comprehension) accuracy scores observed at each value of vocabulary.\nYou can see that the middle -- the average -- of each distribution, marked by a line, increases as we go from left (low scores) to right (high scores).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plots showing the association between the outcome mean accuracy of understanding a predictor, vocabulary knowledge. Both plots show the same data. The plot on the right is modified to show how accuracy of understanding varies between individuals in the sample with the sample vocabulary test scores](Week17_files/figure-html/fig-ridges-1.png){#fig-ridges fig-alt='The figure shows two scatterplots. In both, points represent scores on measures of mean accuracy of understanding and on Shipley vocabulary knowledge. Both plots represent the same data. In the plot on the left, a line indicates the trend where increasing vocabulary scores are associated with higher levels of comprehension accuracy, on average. In the plot on the right, vertical density curves are superimposed on the spread of points at each vocabulary score level. The vertical location of the midline in each curve can be seen to trend upwards for increasing vocabulary.' width=864}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the lecture, I talk about how the information we get from a linear model allows us to *predict* the way in which outcome values may vary (increase or decrease), given different values in the predictor variable.\n\nWe could form a prediction line anywhere but the linear model helps us to estimate the prediction (\"best fit\") line that minimizes the differences between observed and predicted outcomes: *the residuals*, as shown in @fig-lm-show-model-residuals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot showing the prediction of mean accuracy of understanding, given information about participant vocabulary knowledge, with lines drawn to show the difference between observed outcomes (shown in orange-red) and predicted outcomes (shown as black circles on the blue line) for each vocabulary test score value in our sample](Week17_files/figure-html/fig-lm-show-model-residuals-1.png){#fig-lm-show-model-residuals fig-alt='The figure shows a scatterplot in which the points represent scores on measures of mean accuracy of understanding and on Shipley vocabulary knowledge.

Predicted outcomes are shown as black circles on the blue line) for each vocabulary test score value in our sample. Observed sample data points are drawn in orange-red and are more red if they are further away from the prediction line. The difference between observed and predicted accuracy scores are represented with light grey vertical lines.' width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe lectures end with a discussion of the critical information you must identify and extract when you view the summary of a linear model results.\n\nI then show you how to report the results.\nI give you examples of the conventional language you can use to report your results.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn reporting linear model results, we need to explain what they tell us about the association between outcome and predictor variables.\n:::\n\nWe can use visualization to help us to interpret the model estimates.\nIn the how-to guide and in the lab activity workbook (see @sec-w17-resources), we look at how you can draw prediction plots, given model estimates.\n\n### Links to other classes\n\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about, in PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\n- The lectures in *PSYC123* on: (week 2) reliability and validity; (week 3) experimental design, especially between-subjects studies and individual differences; and (week 9) precise hypotheses.\n- The lecture in *PSYC122* (week 13) introducing the linear model. \n\n### Pre-lab activity 1\n\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\n\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.\n\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\n\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link [here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SDgBLz8RrMR3oy)\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n:::\n\n#### Survey information\n\nThe survey asks you to:\n\n- complete some questions about who you are;\n- and then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.\n\nThe survey then asks you to:\n\n- read five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;\n- respond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;\n- and rate how well you think you understand the advice.\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.\nSome people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time.\n\nTaking part in the survey is **completely voluntary**.\nYou can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it.\nIf you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).\n\nAll responses will be recorded completely anonymously.\n\n### Pre-lab activity 1 alternative\n\nIf you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.\n\n[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)\n\n## Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\n### Get your files ready {#sec-w17-resources}\n\nDownload the [122-22-w17_for-students.zip](data/week17/122-22-w17_for-students.zip) files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server.\n\nThe folder includes the data files:\n\n- `study-one-general-participants.csv`\n- `study-two-general-participants.csv`\n\nand the *code files*:\n\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R`\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-workbook.R`\n\nYou will use `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-workbook.R` in the lab activity practical class.\n\n*Alternatively*, you can instead download the resources you need from the week 17 section of the Moodle page for the PSYC122 module:\n\n[Link to Moodle](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38180#section-10)\n\n#### What is in the how-to and workbook.R files?\n\n::: callout-important\n- Our aim is to make sure you can work with code, and write notes *in* the .R files.\n:::\n\nIn the `workbook.R` file you use for the lab activity, we identify tasks and questions, and leave you spaces where you can write code or answers.\n\nIn both the .R files:\n\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R`\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-workbook.R`\n\nwe will take things *step-by-step*.\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Make sure you start at the top of the `.R` file and work your way, in order, through each task.\n- Complete each task before you move on to the next task.\n:::\n\nThe `how-to` guide comprises an .R file `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R` with code and advice.\nThe code in the .R file was written to work with the data file:\n\n- `study-one-general-participants.csv`.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (@sec-w17-activity) in the `how-to` guide.\n\n- Start by looking at the `how-to` guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.\n:::\n\n## Lab activity {#sec-w17-activity}\n\nIn the lab activity .R file `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-workbook.R`, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics):\n\n- `study-two-general-participants.csv`\n\nThe data are similar in format to the response data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project.\n\n### Tasks\n\nIn the activity, we are going to work through the following tasks.\n\n1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`\n2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`\n3. Read in the data file -- using `read_csv()`\n4. Inspect the data -- using `head()` and `summary()`\n5. Visualize the distribution of values -- using `geom_histogram()`\n6. Edit the appearance of the histogram plots, using `binwidth`, `theme_bw()`, `labs()`, `xlim()` and `geom_vline()`\n7. Visualize the potential association between the values of two variables by producing a scatterplot using `geom_point()`\n8. Edit the appearance of the scatterplots by using the `geom_point()` arguments `alpha`, `size`, `colour`, and `shape`, and by changing the axis limits using `xlim()` and `ylim()`.\n9. Revise how you test the associations between pairs of variables through correlation analyses using `cor.test()`\n10. Examine the predictive relation between outcome and predictor variables using  `lm()`\n11. Visualize the model predictions -- using `geom_abline()` and information from the model results\n\nThe activity `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-workbook.R` file takes you through the tasks, one by one.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, look in `2022-23-PSYC122-w17-how-to.R`.\n:::\n\nIn the `how-to`, you will see that you can match a task in the `activity` to the same task in the `how-to`.\nThe `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.\nYou will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.\n\n### What is in the data files\n\nEach of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.\n\nYou can see the columns:\n\n- `participant_ID` participant code\n- `mean.acc` average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance\n- `mean.self` average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance\n- `study` varianble coding for what study the data were collected in\n- `AGE` age in years\n- `HLVA` health literacy test score\n- `SHIPLEY` vocabulary knowledge test score\n- `FACTOR3` reading strategy survey score\n- `GENDER` gender code\n- `EDUCATION` education level code\n- `ETHNICITY` ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code\n\n### Answers {#sec-w17-answers}\n\n::: callout-tip\nYou can now download the answers version of the activity workbook .R [here](data/week17/2022-23-PSYC122-w17-workbook-answers.R).\n:::\n\nThe answers version presents my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful.",
