Week 17 -- Better understanding the linear model\nsubtitle: Written by Rob Davies\norder: 6\n---\n\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis page is under construction: come back soon!\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_c9c12e74319196ab76292ccf4375c3f5'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_374049107faf158b8a3c30df60f1daac'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## week 17: Introduction {#sec-wk17-introduction}\n\nWelcome to your overview of our work together in **PSYC122 Week 17**.\n\nWe will complete four classes in **weeks 16-19**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n*Putting it all together*\n\n- These classes are designed to help you to revise and to put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.\n- We will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the **Clearly Understood** project.\n:::\n\nWe will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of a real research project because we think that this *context* will help you to make sense of the data, and it will help you to see *why* we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching.\n\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes.\nThis will give you the opportunity to *revise* and *consolidate* your learning.\nWe will *extend* your development with some new ideas, to help you to strengthen your skills.\n\nWe will observe real scientific findings using the data we will collect together.\nThese new findings will ultimately show health providers how to communicate their advice more effectively.\n\n### Our learning goals\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn week 17, we will ask you to do three things.\n\n- *First* we will ask you to do a pre-lab activity that involves completing a survey.\n- *Second* we will ask you to do a set of practical tasks in the lab activity that are designed to consolidate your learning on data **visualization**.\n- *Third* we will ask you to **think critically** about potential associations between measures of individual differences and measures of how well people understand health information.\n:::\n\nCompleting the survey will help you to understand the numbers you will be working with in the activities: where they come from, and what they show about the people tested.\nIt will also help to teach you about the challenges of measurement: this is one of the key challenges in psychological science.\n\nWe will build practice in using correlations to test predictions about associations and *thus* to answer research questions.\n\n## Lectures {#sec-wk17-lectures}\n\n::: callout-tip\nBefore you go on to the activities, **watch** the lectures:\n:::\n\nThe lecture for this week is presented in four short parts.\nYou can view video recordings of the lectures using Panopto, by clicking on the links shown following.\n\n1. **Overview** (19 minutes): What we are doing in week 17 -- thinking critically about predicting people.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe

prediction** (11 minutes): How we answer live research questions by using linear models to predict behaviour.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=d9d5ade2-e10c-4e14-b938-afb000f2634c&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n3. **How linear models work** (9 minutes): How we can visualize and think about predictions, and about the difference between what we predict and what we observe when we study people.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=44dfb2c3-80d3-4fa6-8978-afb000f63c17&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\"

visualizing** linear model results (15 minutes): Identifying, interpreting and communicating the key statistics.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=4a20cb70-618c-4bf3-999a-afb000f9bdcf&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\"

presented in the videos can be downloaded either as a web page or as a Word document.\n:::\n\n- [The slides](data/week17/122-linear-model-intro.html) exactly as presented (21 MB). \n- [The slides](data/week17/122-linear-model-intro-printable-edit.docx) converted to a Word .docx (1 MB). \n\nYou can download the web page `.html` file and click on it to open it in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge or Safari). The slide images are high quality so the file is quite big and may take a few seconds to download.\n\nYou can download the `.docx` file and click on it to open it as a Word document that you can then edit. \nConverting the slides to a .docx distorts some images but the benefit of the conversion is that it makes it easier for you to add your notes.\n\n## Reading: Links to other classes\n\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\n- The lectures in *PSYC123* on: the scientific method; reliability and validity; experimental design, especially between-subjects studies; hypothesis testing; and precise hypotheses.\n- The lecture in *PSYC122* on correlations. \n\n## Pre-lab activities {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities}\n\n### Pre-lab activity 1 {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities-1}\n\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\n\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from *PSYC122* students: **you**.\n\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\n\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link [here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0qdj8TOZc18LR0q)\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n:::\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.\n\nTaking part in the survey is **completely voluntary**.\nYou can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it.\nIf you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).\n\nAll responses will be recorded completely anonymously.\n\n### Pre-lab activity alternative option {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities-2}\n\nIf you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.\n\n[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)\n\n## Lab activities {#sec-wk6-lab-activities}\n\n### Introduction {#sec-wk6-lab-activities-1-introduction}\n\nWe will do our practical lab work to develop your skills in the context of the **Clearly Understood** project.\n\n- Our focus will be on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information.\n\n**Why are we doing this?**\n\nWe encounter written health information all the time: in warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about.\nIt is not always easy to understand this information.\nThe problem is that it is unclear how health information *should* be communicated: even this is important, there is not much evidence.\n\nAs psychologists, **we can help**.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions:\n\n1. What person attributes predict success in understanding health information?\n2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?\n:::\n\n### Get ready {#sec-wk6-prelab-activities-ready}\n\n#### Download the data \n\nClick on the link: [122_week16_for_students.zip](data/week16/122_week16_for_students.zip) to download the data files folder.

callout-tip\nIt is always a good idea to view the dataset -- click on the name of the dataset in the R-Studio `Environment` window, and check out the columns, scroll through the rows -- to get a sense of what you are working with.\n:::\n\n### Lab activity 1: Work with the `How-to` guide {#sec-wk6-lab-activities-1}\n\nThe `how-to` guide comprises an .Rmd file:\n\n- `2023-24-PSYC122-w16-how-to.Rmd`\n\nIt is full of advice and example code.\n\nThe code in the `how-to` guide was written to work with the data file:\n\n- `study-one-general-participants.csv`.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (@sec-wk6-lab-activities-2, next) in the `how-to` guide.\n\n- Start by looking at the `how-to` guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.\n:::\n\nWe will take things *step-by-step*.\n\nWe split .Rmd scripts by steps, tasks and questions:  \n\n- different steps for different phases of the analysis workflow;\n- different tasks for different things you need to do;\n- different questions to examine different ideas or coding challenges\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Make sure you start at the top of the `.Rmd` file and work your way, in order, through each task.\n- Complete each task before you move on to the next task.\n:::\n\nIn the activity @sec-wk6-lab-activities-2, we are going to work through the following tasks.\n\n**Step 1: Set-up**\n\n1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`\n2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`\n\n**Step 2: Load the data**\n\n3. Read in the data file -- using `read_csv()`\n4. Inspect the data -- using `head()` and `summary()`\n5. Change the type classification of a variable in the data -- using `as.factor()`\n\n**Step 3: Use histograms to examine the distributions of variables**\n\n6. Draw histograms to examine the distributions of variables -- using `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`\n\n**Step 4: Edit your plots to make them look good**\n\n7. Edit the appearance of one histogram plot step-by-step\n\n**Step 5: Now draw scatterplots to examine associations between variables**\n\n8. Draw scatterplots to examine the associations between some variables -- using `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`\n9. Draw scatterplots to examine different variables\n\n**Step 6: Edit the scatterplots to make them look good**\n\n10. Edit the appearance of a plot step-by-step\n\n**Step 7: Use correlation to to answer the research questions**\n\n11. Examine associations between variables using correlation.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, look at the advice in `2023-24-PSYC122-w16-how-to.Rmd` on how to do the tasks, with examples on how to write the code.\n:::\n\nYou will see that you can match a task in the activity @sec-wk6-lab-activities-2 to the same task in the `how-to` guide.\nThe `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.\n\nThis process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in modern psychological science.\n\n::: callout-warning\nDon't forget: You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.\n:::\n\n### Lab activity 2 {#sec-wk6-lab-activities-2}\n\n### OK: now let's do it!\n\nIn the following, we will guide you through the tasks and questions step by step.\nYou will learn more if you follow this advice:\n\n::: callout-tip\n1. We will hide the code to do some tasks behind a drop-down button. Try to write and run the code for yourself first.\n2. We won't always give you the code required to do something: this gives you the chance to check what you have learned by trying out your code without the answer in front of you.\n3. We will not *at first* give you the answers to questions about the data or about the results of analyses. \n4. An answers version of the workbook will be provided after the last lab session (check the answers then in @sec-wk6-lab-activities-answers) so that you can check whether your independent work has been correct.\n:::\n\n#### Questions {#sec-wk6-lab-activities-1-questions}\n\n#### Step 1: Set-up\n\nTo begin, we set up our environment in R.\n\n##### Task 1 -- Run code to empty the R environment\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_a51f17eee0be963269b898e4d0437745'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list=ls())                            \n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Task 2 -- Run code to load relevant libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_f2c83e0f392203e8ed0c466d8065b20c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Step 2: Load the data\n\n##### Task 3 -- Read in the data file we will be using\n\nThe data file for the *workbook* is called:\n\n- `study-two-general-participants.csv`\n\nUse the `read_csv()` function to read the data file into R.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_56c11a5feef2c7e4ac52b2bee790dc86'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstudy.two.gen <- read_csv(\"study-two-general-participants.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWhen you code this, you can choose your own file name, but be sure to give the data object you create a distinct name e.g. `study.two.gen`.\n\n##### Task 4 -- Inspect the data file\n\nUse the `summary()` or `head()` functions to take a look\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Code\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week17_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_39bacedb9425e8fe757865c6579a37de'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(study.two.gen)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n>**Q.1.** What is the median of `AGE`?\n\n<!-- - A.1. 32.50   -->\n\n>**Q.2.** What class is the variable `ETHNICITY`?\n\n<!-- - A.2. character   -->\n\n>**Q.3.** Does the summary indicate if any variable has missing values (NAs)?\n\n<!-- - Q.3.
