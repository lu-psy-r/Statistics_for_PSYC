Week 19 -- Linear models -- critical perspectives\nsubtitle: Written by Rob Davies\norder: 8\n---\n\n\n::: callout-warning\nThis page is under construction: come back soon!\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week19_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_161f4021008ef174cbb205f873659790'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='Week19_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_9d2d50e277e2137a2563b9898feb92b8'}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Week 19: Introduction {#sec-wk19-introduction}\n\nWelcome to your overview of our work together in **PSYC122 Week 19**.\n\n::: callout-tip\n*Putting it all together*\n\n- We have completed four classes in **weeks 16-19**.\n- These classes are designed to enable you to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.\n- We have been doing this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the **Clearly Understood** project.\n:::\n\nIn the week 19 class, we **will aim to answer** two research questions:\n\n1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?\n2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written information?\n\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes.\nAnd we will be extending your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.\n\n::: callout-tip\nI have said that our aim in these classes is to contribute new findings from the data we collect together.\n\n- **That time is now.**\n:::\n\nThe PSYC122 health comprehension survey is now closed, and we will focus our practical work in week 19 on analyzing the data we have collected.\n\n### Our learning goals\n\nIn Week 19, we aim to further develop skills in *analyzing* and in *visualizing* psychological data.\n\nWe will use linear models to estimate the association between predictors and outcomes in order to answer our research questions.\n\n::: callout-tip\n**What is new** here is that we will compare the results from different studies to critically examine questions relating to **reproducibility**:\n\n- Do we see similar results when similar methods are used to collect data to address the same questions?\n:::\n\nWe shall be focusing our analysis work on response data *contributed by PSYC122 students*.\n\n- But we will critically examine whether the results of our analyses of PSYC122 data are or are not similar to the results of the analyses of data collected in other studies.\n\nWhen we do linear models, as you have seen, we usually need to report:  \n\n- information about **the model we specify**, identifying *all* predictors;\n- our evaluation of **whether the effects** of one or more predictors **are significant**;\n- model **fit statistics** (`F, R-squared`) as well as coefficient estimates;\n- and **descriptions of the impact** of predictors.\n\nUsually, in describing the impacts of predictors, we are required to communicate:\n\n- the **direction** of the effect -- do values of the outcome variable *increase* or *decrease* given increasing values of the predictor?\n- the **size** of the effect -- *how much* do values of the outcome variable *increase* or *decrease* given increasing values of the predictor?\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn assessing **reproducibility**, therefore, we may focus here on:\n\n1. Whether an effect is or is not significant in the datasets we are comparing;\n2. Whether the estimate of the coefficient for the slope of an effect of interest has similar sign (positive or negative) or size (the value of the coefficient) in the datasets we are comparing.\n:::\n\n## Lectures {#sec-wk19-lectures}\n\n::: callout-tip\nBefore you go on to the activities in @sec-wk19-lab-activities, **watch** the lectures:\n:::\n\nThe lecture for this week is presented in four short parts.\nYou can view video recordings of the lectures using Panopto, by clicking on the video images shown following.\n\n- Anybody who has the link should be able to view the video.\n\n1. **Overview** (17 minutes): Critical perspectives -- The real challenge in psychological science (people vary, results vary) -- variation, replication and evaluating evidence across multiple studies.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=0e35b8e9-dd4f-4fb7-a88e-afbe010b250a&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n2. **The Clearly Understood project -- questions and analyses** (13 minutes): Critical thinking -- candidate answers, our assumptions, the sources of uncertainty, and working with samples.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=6d20197c-6559-463b-8672-afbe011e2371&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n3. **Evaluating evidence across studies** (18 minutes): People vary, results vary -- evaluating, thinking about, critically reflecting on analysis results\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=22d3bf7c-1710-4a75-9a73-b12b00b502b1&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n4. **Becoming a power learner** (24 minutes): Reproducibility, sharing, and learning to exploit the R knowledge ecosystem -- every question you ever have has an answer somewhere online; find out how to locate and use this knowledge for yourself.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://lancaster.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=3633c4c0-e364-4d8f-beba-b12b00bb18f7&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded either as a web page or as a Word document.\n:::\n\n- [The slides](data/week19/122-linear-model-perspectives.html) exactly as presented (21 MB).\n- [The slides](data/week19/122-linear-model-perspectives-printable-edit.docx) converted to a Word .docx (11 MB). \n\nYou can download the web page `.html` file and click on it to open it in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge or Safari). The slide images are high quality and there are a lot of them, so the file is quite big; it may take a few seconds to download.\n\nYou can download the `.docx` file and click on it to open it as a Word document that you can then edit. \nConverting the slides to a .docx distorts some images but the benefit of the conversion is that it makes it easier for you to add your notes.\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo work with our lecture recordings:\n\n- Watch the video parts right through.\n- Use the printable versions of the slides to make notes.\n- Try out the coding exercises in the how-to guide and the activity tasks or questions (@sec-wk19-lab-activities) to learn how to construct visualizations and do analyses.\n:::\n\n### The lectures have four main areas of focus {#sec-wk19-lectures-focus}\n\n**1. The real challenges in psychological science**\n\nWe step back to get a broader perspective on what we are doing when we are doing psychological science. We look at some of the *real* challenges that professional psychologists work with, as we attempt to build a scientific understanding of what people think and do, and why they do it.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWhat makes psychological science challenging:\n\n1. People vary\n2. Results vary\n:::\n\n**2. Critical thinking**\n\nThe power and flexibility of the linear model presents challenges.\nWe must decide which candidate predictor variables we specify in our model.\nThis means *we must* think critically.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe can develop our critical thinking skills by considering:\n\n1. Our assumptions about:\n\n- validity;\n- measurement;\n- generalizability.\n\n2. Sources of uncertainty about:\n\n- predicted change in outcomes, given our predictors;\n- ways that expected changes vary between people or groups;\n- random ways that specific responses can be produced.\n:::\n\n**3. Evaluating evidence across multiple studies**\n\nAll important questions in the psychological scientific literature are addressed in *multiple studies*: how do we evaluate the evidence, comparing the results from different studies?\n\n::: callout-tip\nHow do we *build* knowledge in psychological science?\n\nWe consider:\n\n- replication\n- reproducibility\n\nAnd how to assess results across multiple studies.\n:::\n\nThese are complex concerns and you will learn more about them, in other modules, this year and next year, when you develop an understanding of systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and the critical evaluation of scientific evidence.\n\n**4. How to become a power user**\n\nYou have been learning about data analysis using R. We have been providing rich learning materials but in Week 19 we start to explore the wider world of knowledge about data analysis and R.\n\n::: callout-tip\nR is *free* and *open*. This means that:\n\n- there is a vast knowledge ecosystem you can use for your own purposes;\n- learning to be a powerful data analyst involves learning how to locate and to use the resources that are out there.\n:::\n\nWe hope that these lessons are just the start for many of you.\n\n*Every* problem you ever have: \n\n- someone has had it before;\n- solved it;\n- and written a blog or social media post or recorded a YouTube or TikTok about it.\n\n## Reading: Links to other classes\n\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\n- The lectures in *PSYC123* on: the scientific method; reliability and validity; experimental design, especially between-subjects studies; hypothesis testing; and precise hypotheses.\n- The lecture in *PSYC122* on linear models. \n\n## Pre-lab activities {#sec-wk19-prelab-activities}\n\n### Pre-lab activity 1 {#sec-wk19-prelab-activities-1}\n\nThe survey is now closed.\n\nIf you want more information about the project, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.\n\n[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)\n\n## Lab activities {#sec-wk19-lab-activities}\n\n### Introduction {#sec-wk19-lab-activities-1-introduction}\n\nWe will do our practical lab work to develop your skills in the context of the **Clearly Understood** project.\n\n- Our focus is on what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn Week 19, we aim to answer the research questions:\n\n1. What person attributes predict success in understanding health information?\n2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?\n:::\n\nPSYC122 students contributed their responses to a survey we have been using to collect data to find answers to these questions.\n\nIn our practical work, we will be examining the PSYC122 data but, as we do so, we should understand that no one study in psychological science will give us definitive answers to any interesting question about people and what they do.\n\nIn the practical work, you will be asked to reflect on how data from different studies -- using the same methods, with the same aims -- may nevertheless vary: \n\n- vary in the data distributions;\n- and vary in the results that analyses indicate.\n\nCritically evaluating results across a series of studies, or replication attempts, is part of the process of accumulating evidence to build insight in psychological science, given measurement under uncertainty and limits in samples.\n\n### Get ready {#sec-wk19-prelab-activities-ready}\n\n#### Download the data\n\nClick on the link: [122-week19_for_students.zip](data/week19/122-week19_for_students.zip) to download the data files folder.

columns:\n\n- `participant_ID` participant code;\n- `mean.acc` average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance (varies between 0-1);\n- `mean.self` average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance (varies between 1-9);\n- `study` variable coding for what study the data were collected in\n- `AGE` age in years;\n- `HLVA` health literacy test score (varies between 1-16);\n- `SHIPLEY` vocabulary knowledge test score (varies between 0-40);\n- `FACTOR3` reading strategy survey score (varies between 0-80);\n- `GENDER` gender code;\n- `EDUCATION` education level code;\n- `ETHNICITY` ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIt is always a good idea to view the dataset -- click on the name of the dataset in the R-Studio `Environment` window, and check out the columns, scroll through the rows -- to get a sense of what you are working with.\n:::\n\n### Lab activity 1: Work with the `How-to` guide {#sec-wk19-lab-activities-1}\n\nThe `how-to` guide comprises an .Rmd file:\n\n- `2023-24-PSYC122-w19-how-to.Rmd`\n\nIt is full of advice and example code.\n\nThe code in the `how-to` guide was written to work with **two data files**:\n\n- `study-one-general-participants.csv`\n- `study-two-general-participants.csv`\n\nWe will be working with *your* (PSYC122) response data in @sec-wk19-lab-activities-2.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (@sec-wk19-lab-activities-2, shown following) in the `how-to` guide.\n\n- Start by looking at the `how-to` guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.\n:::\n\nWe will take things *step-by-step*.\n\nWe split .Rmd scripts by steps, tasks and questions:\n\n- different steps for different phases of the analysis workflow;\n- different tasks for different things you need to do;\n- different questions to examine different ideas or coding challenges\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Make sure you start at the top of the `.Rmd` file and work your way, in order, through each task.\n- Complete each task before you move on to the next task.\n:::\n\nIn the activity @sec-wk19-lab-activities-2, we are going to work through a sequence of steps and tasks that mirrors the sequence you find in the `how-to` guide.\n\n- There is a little bit of variation, comparing the later steps in the `how-to` guide and the steps in @sec-wk19-lab-activities-2, but that variation is designed to help you with your learning.\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Notice that we are gradually building up our skills: consolidating what we know; revising important learning; and extending ourselves to acquire new skills.\n:::\n\n**Step 1: Set-up**\n\n1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`\n2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`\n\n**Step 2: Load the data**\n\n3. Read in the data files -- using `read_csv()`\n4. Inspect both datasets -- using `head()` and `summary()`\n\n**Step 3: Compare the data from the different studies**\n\n5. Compare the data distributions from the two studies -- using `geom_histogram()` \n6-7. and by constructing grids of plots\n\n**Step 4: Use scatterplots and correlation to examine associations between variables**\n\n8. Draw scatterplots to compare the potential association between variables\n9. Create grids of plots to make side-by-side comparisons of associations in different datasets\n10. Estimate the associations between pairs of variables and compare the estimates\n\n**Step 5: Use a linear model to to answer the research questions -- models with multiple predictors**\n\n11. Examine the relation between one outcome and multiple predictors\n12. Do this in comparable datasets, and compare summaries or plots\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, look at the advice in `2023-24-PSYC122-w19-how-to.Rmd` on how to do the tasks, with examples on how to write the code.\n:::\n\nYou will see that you can match a task in the activity @sec-wk19-lab-activities-2 to the same task in the `how-to` guide.\nThe `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.\n\nThis process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in modern psychological science.\n\n::: callout-warning\nDon't forget: You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in @sec-wk19-lab-activities-2.\n:::\n\n### Lab activity 2 {#sec-wk19-lab-activities-2}\n\n### OK: now let's do it!\n\nIn the following, we will guide you through the tasks and questions step by step.\n\n::: callout-tip\n1. We will not *at first* give you the answers to questions about the data or about the results of analyses.\n2. An answers version of the workbook will be provided after the last lab session (check the answers then in @sec-wk19-lab-activities-answers) so that you can check whether your independent work has been correct.\n:::\n\n#### Questions {#sec-wk19-lab-activities-2-questions}\n\n::: callout-warning\n**Students have told us** that it would be helpful to your learning if we reduce the information in the hints we provide you. **We have done this** in Week 19.\n\nThe motivation for doing this is:\n\n1.

You have to look carefully at the y-axis scale information to make a judgment about the relative width of these uncertainty ellipses. -->\n\n<!-- The visualizations plus the model summaries suggests that the estimates of the effect of health literacy are different in the `study.122` compared to the `study.two.gen` data. Why is that? -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- We can redraw the prediction plots to add in more information about our samples. This change, see following, will help us to interpret the results of the analyses we have done. -->\n<!-- And *that* will help you to see why data visualization and data analysis work well together. -->\n\n<!-- In the `{ggeffects}` online information, you can see links to practical examples. Can you use the information under `Practical examples` to adjust the appearance of the prediction plots: to make them black and white; to add points? -->\n\n<!-- First create the plots. -->\n\n<!-- :::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"} -->\n<!-- ## Code -->\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- dat.two <- ggpredict(model.two, \"HLVA\") -->\n<!-- plot.two <- plot(dat.two, colors = \"bw\", add.data = TRUE) + labs(title = \"Study Two\") -->\n<!-- dat.122 <- ggpredict(model.122, \"HLVA\") -->\n<!-- plot.122 <- plot(dat.122, colors = \"bw\", add.data = TRUE) + labs(title = \"Study PSYC122\") -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- Then show the plots in a grid, to allow comparison of the effect of `HLVA` between studies in a *professional* presentation. -->\n\n<!-- :::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"} -->\n<!-- ## Code -->\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- plot.two + plot.122 -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ::: calloutbox-tip -->\n<!-- It is often useful to compare model estimates -- here, the slopes -- with the raw data observations. -->\n\n<!-- - No model will be perfect. -->\n<!-- - Visualizing the difference between what we observe and what we predict helps to make sense of how our prediction model could be improved. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- >**Q.24.** Given the information in the adjusted plots, can you explain why we appear to be more uncertain about the `HLVA` effect given the `study.122` data? -->\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"} -->\n<!-- - A.24. Adding points allow us to see: -->\n\n<!-- 1. There are far fewer observations in the `study.122` dataset than in the `study.two.gen` data: this means that our estimate of the effect will be *more uncertain* because we have *less information* when we look at the `study.122` data. -->\n<!-- 2. But it is also clear that the effect of `HLVA` appears to be stronger in the  `study.122` data because observed scores are *closer* to model predictions: the `HLVA` effect *explains more variation* in the `study.122` data than in the `study.two.gen` data. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n## Online Q&A {#sec-wk19-lab-Q-and-A}\n\nYou will find, below, a link to the video recording of the Week 19 online Q&A after it has been completed.\n\n\n```{=html}\n```\n",
