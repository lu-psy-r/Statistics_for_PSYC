Data Visualisation\nsubtitle: Written by Rob Davies\norder: 7\n---\n\n## PSYC122 *Part 2* Week 16 {#sec-week-16-intro}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWelcome to your overview of the materials and guidance you will work with in **PSYC122 Week 16**.\n\nWe will complete four classes in weeks 16-19.\nThese classes are designed to help students to revise and put into practice some of the key ideas and skills you have been developing in the first year research methods modules *PSYC121, PSYC123 and PSYC124*.\n\nWe will do this in the context of a live research project with potential real world impacts: the **Clearly understood** project.\n\n- Our focus will be on **what makes it easy or difficult for people to understand written health information**.\n\nWe encounter written health information all the time: in warnings signs, on medication labels, in clinics when we go to see the doctor, and online when we research things we are worried about.\nIt is not always easy to understand this information.\nThe problem is that it is unclear how health information should be communicated.\nAs psychologists, we can help to improve health communication.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn these classes, we will complete a research project to answer the research questions:\n\n1. What person attributes predict success in understanding?\n2. Can people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?\n:::\n\nWe will present our PSYC122 lessons in the context of this research project because we think that this *context* will help you to make sense of the data, and to see why we ask you to practice the skills we are teaching.\n\nWe will be revisiting some of the ideas and techniques you have seen introduced in previous classes.\nThis is to give you the opportunity to *revise* and *consolidate* your learning.\nWe will *extend* your development with some new ideas, to strengthen your skills.\n\nUltimately, we aim to contribute new findings from the data we will collect together.\nThese new findings will, we hope, help to make the provision of health advice a bit more useful in future.\n\n### Our learning goals\n\nIn Week 16, we will ask you to do three things.\n\n::: callout-note\n*First*, we will ask you to do a pre-lab activity that involves completing a survey.\n:::\n\n- Completing the survey will help you to make sense of the numbers you will be working with in the activities.\n- Completing the pre-lab activity will help to teach you about the challenges of measurement, a key aspect of the scientific thinking skills we will help you to develop.\n\n::: callout-note\n*Second*, we will ask you to do a set of practical tasks in the lab activity that are designed to consolidate your learning on *data visualization*.\n:::\n\n1. We will be:\n\n- Using histograms to examine the distributions of variables;\n- Learning to edit the histograms to present them professionally.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How-to guide example of a histogram showing observed mean accuracy of understanding of health information](Week16_files/figure-html/fig-histogram-1.png){#fig-histogram fig-alt='The figure presents a histogram representing the distribution of mean accuracy scores in the study one dataset. The distribution is skewed with a peak around .8 and a long tail towards lower scores.' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. We will be:\n\n- Using scatterplots to examine the association of variables;\n- Learning to edit the plots to present them professionally.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How-to guide example of a scatterplot representing the potential association between values of health literacy (HLVA) and mean self-rated accuracy of understanding of health information.](Week16_files/figure-html/fig-scatterplot-1.png){#fig-scatterplot fig-alt='The figure presents a scatterplot: points in dark blue represent the potential covariation in health literacy (shown in the x-axis position) and mean self-rated accuracy of understanding of health information. The cloud of points appear to trend upwards so that higher levels of health literacy are assocaited with higher self-rated accuracy.' width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n*Third*, we will ask you to think critically about predictions about potential associations between measures of participant attributes and measures of understanding of health information.\n:::\n\n- We will use correlations to test predictions about associations and *thus* answer research questions.\n\n## Your resources {#sec-resources-intro}\n\nYou will see -- below -- links to the lectures, information about the data we will analyze, and an explanation of the activities.\n\nAll the links to the lectures, and everything you need for your practical work class can *also* be found in the **Week 16 files** folder on Moodle, here:\n\n[Link to Moodle](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38180#section-10)\n\n### Lectures: video recordings {#sec-resources-videos}\n\nThe lecture material for this week is presented in four short parts.\n\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the *Panopto* video for the lecture part.\n(You will need to be on campus or logged in to the university VPN to get access to the videos.)\n\n[Part 1 of 4; about 15 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=219a5ba8-cce8-43e3-afea-afaa010f2d91)\n\n[Part 2 of 4; about 11 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6fd6d7e9-7457-441d-a689-afaa0113f62d)\n\n[Part 3 of 4; about 22 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5bbbe88e-b701-4658-b484-afaa011819e3)\n\n[Part 4 of 4; about 11 minutes](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ec9bbeb3-ad95-48e1-a03f-afaa012037f9)\n\nThe lecture is designed to give you an overview of:\n\n1. What we are doing in weeks 16-20, *and* how and why you will develop your critical thinking skills;\n2. A summary of the health communication project, and the ideas we assume to develop our hypotheses;\n3. How we visualize and think about distributions and associations;\n4. And how we use R to estimate and test correlations.\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo work with the recordings:\n\n- Watch the video parts right through.\n- Use the printable versions of the slides (provided on Moodle) to make notes.\n- Try out the coding exercises in the how-to and the workbook (see @sec-resources) to see for yourself how you can construct visualizations and do analyses.\n:::\n\n### Links to other classes\n\nWe do not provide further reading for this class but you will find it helpful to revise some of the key ideas you have been learning about PSYC122 and in other modules.\n\n- The lectures in *PSYC123* on: (week 1) the scientific method; (week 2) reliability and validity; (week 3) experimental design, especially between-subjects studies; (week 6) hypothesis testing; and (week 9) precise hypotheses.\n- The lecture in *PSYC122* on (week 11) correlation. \n\n### Pre-lab activity 1\n\nIn weeks 16-19, we will be working together on a research project to investigate how people vary in their response to health advice.\n\nCompleting the project involves collecting responses from PSYC122 students.\n\nTo enter your responses, we invite you to complete a short survey.\n\nComplete the survey by clicking on the link [here](https://lancasteruni.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SDgBLz8RrMR3oy)\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn our week 19 class activity, we will analyze the data we collect here.\n:::\n\n#### Survey information\n\nThe survey asks you to:\n\n- complete some questions about who you are;\n- and then answer some questions about what you know about some English words, about what you know about health matters, and about how you approach reading.\n\nThe survey then asks you to:\n\n- read five short extracts from patient information leaflets about different kinds of health issue;\n- respond to some multiple choice questions about each extract;\n- and rate how well you think you understand the advice.\n\nThe survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.\nSome people will take less time, and some people might take a little more time.\n\nTaking part in the survey is **completely voluntary**.\nYou can stop at any time without completing the survey if you do not want to finish it.\nIf you do not want to do the survey, you can do an alternative activity (see below).\n\nAll responses will be recorded completely anonymously.\n\n### Pre-lab activity 1 alternative\n\nIf you do not want to complete the survey, we invite you to read the pre-registered research plan for the *PSYC122 health advice* research project.\n\n[Read the project pre-registration](https://osf.io/p6fsc/)\n\n### Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\n#### Get your files ready {#sec-resources}\n\nDownload the [122-22-w16_for-students.zip](data/week16/122-22-w16_for-students.zip) files you need and upload them to your RStudio Server.\n\nThe folder includes data files:\n\n- `study-one-general-participants.csv`\n- `study-two-general-participants.csv`\n\nand the *code files*:\n\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R`\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R`\n\n*Alternatively*, you can instead download the resources you need from the module Moodle page for PSYC122:\n\n[Link to Moodle](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38180#section-10)\n\n#### What is in the how-to and workbook.R files?\n\n::: callout-important\nYou have been getting used to working with .R *script* files.\n\n- Now our aim is to make sure you can work with code, and write notes *in* the files.\n- In the `workbook` you use for the lab activity, we identify tasks and questions, and leave you spaces where you can write code or answers.\n:::\n\nIn both the .R files:\n\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R`\n- `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R`\n\nwe will take things *step-by-step*.\n\nWe split .R scripts into parts, tasks and questions:  \n\n- different parts for different phases of the analysis process;\n- different tasks for different steps in each phase;\n- different questions to examine different ideas or coding steps.\n\n::: callout-tip\n- Make sure you start at the top of the `.R` file and work your way, in order, through each task.\n- Complete each task before you move on to the next task.\n:::\n\n### Review the how-to guide {#sec-how-to}\n\nThe `how-to` guide comprises an .R file `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R` with code and advice.\nThe code in the .R file was written to work with the data file:\n\n- `study-one-general-participants.csv`.\n\n::: callout-tip\nWe show you how to do everything you need to do in the lab activity (@sec-activity) in the `how-to` guide.\n\n- Start by looking at the `how-to` guide to understand what steps you need to follow in the lab activity.\n:::\n\n### Lab activity {#sec-activity}\n\nIn the lab activity .R file `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R`, you will work with data from a study about how people respond to guidance about a variety of health topics (general topics):\n\n- `study-two-general-participants.csv`\n\nThe data are similar in format to the response data we are collecting as part of the PSYC122 project.\n\n#### Tasks\n\nIn the activity *workbook*, we are going to work through the following tasks.\n\n1. Empty the R environment -- using `rm(list=ls())`\n2. Load relevant libraries -- using `library()`\n3. Read in the data file -- using `read_csv()`\n4. Inspect the data -- using `head()` and `summary()`\n5. Change the type classification of a variable in the data -- using `as.factor()`\n6. Draw histograms to examine the distributions of variables -- using `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`\n7. Edit the appearance of *one variable* histogram plot step-by-step\n8. Draw scatterplots to examine the associations between some variables -- using `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`\n9. Draw scatterplots to examine different variables\n10. Edit the appearance of a plot step-by-step\n11. Examine associations between variables using correlation.\n\nThe activity `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-workbook.R` file takes you through the tasks, one by one.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are unsure about what you need to do, look at the advice in `2022-23-PSYC122-w16-how-to.R` on what steps you have to follow, and examples on how to write the code.\n:::\n\nYou will see that you can match a task in the `activity` to the same task in the `how-to`.\nThe `how-to` shows you what function you need and how you should write the function code.\n\n- Don't forget: You will need to change the names of the dataset or the variables to complete the tasks in the activity.\n\nThis process of adapting demonstration code is a process critical to data literacy and to effective problem solving in working with data in psychological science.\n\n#### What is in the data files\n\nEach of the data files we will work with has a similar structure, as you can see in this extract.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto;
