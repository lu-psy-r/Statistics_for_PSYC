Week 11 - Correlation\nsubtitle: Written by Margriet Groen (some parts are adapted from materials developed by the PsyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Neuroscience; see [here](https://psyteachr.github.io/analysis-v2/correlations.html))\norder: 2\n---\n\n\nToday we will take a look at correlation as a measure of association between two numerical variables. We will create scatterplots to visualise correlations, we will run a correlation analysis and we will practise interpreting and reporting the results.\n\n## Lectures {#sec-wk11-lectures}\n\nThe lecture material comes in two parts.\n\n1.  **Theory**(~30 minutes) \nWatch this part before you complete the reading and the pre-lab activities. The video has captions, in case you find that helpful. You can download the slides and a transcript from the links below the video. Finally, if you open the video in 'eStream' by clicking on the green 'e' in the bottom right, you can navigate to separate sections of the video by clicking on the 'chapters' pane. This might be particularly useful if you quickly want to revisit a particular section.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"282\" width=\"500\" src=\"https://estream.lancaster.ac.uk/Embed.aspx?id=71802&amp;code=e0~6wwB9wNEirzQhykLayGTxEAxLB7N9i&amp;cc=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n```\n\n[Slides](data/week11/stats_correlation_theory_20240103.pdf) [Transcript](data/week11/01statscorrelationtheory20240103.txt)\n\n2.  **How to**(~13 minutes)\nWatch this part after you've completed the pre-lab activities and before you attend the lab session.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"282\" width=\"500\" src=\"https://estream.lancaster.ac.uk/Embed.aspx?id=71956&amp;code=e8~FtztV5mEr3G6oMLZUHkFG48cByFRV8&amp;cc=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n```\n\n[Slides](data/week11/stats_correlation_howto_20240110.pdf)\n[Transcript](data/week11/02statscorrelationhowto20240110.txt)\n\n## Reading {#sec-wk11-reading}\n\nThe reading that accompanies the lectures this week and next week is from [**chapter 9 of the core text by Howell (2017)**](https://onesearch.lancaster-university.uk/permalink/f/cssk39/44LAN_ALMA_DS51180136050001221).\n\nRougly, **this week** we'll cover the material in sections 9.1 to 9.4, as well as sections 9.8 to 9.11 and section 9.15. **Next week,** we'll cover the material in sections 9.5 to 9.7, and sections 9.12 to 9.13. Even if a section is not mentioned here, all of chapter 9 is relevant.\n\n## Pre-lab activities\n\nAfter having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook sections you'll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\n### Pre-lab activity 1: Visualing correlations {#sec-wk11-prelab-visualising-correlations}\n\nHave a look at [**this visualisation of correlations**](https://rpsychologist.com/correlation/) by Kristoffer Magnusson.\n\nAfter having read the relevant sections of Howell (2017) Chapter 9, use this visualisation page to visually replicate the scatterplots in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 - use a sample of 100. After that, visually replicate the scatterplots in Figure 9.3.\n\nEach time you change the correlation, pay attention to the shared variance (the overlap between the two variables) and see how this changes with the changing level of relationship between the two variables. The greater the shared variance, the stronger the relationship.\n\nAlso, try setting the correlation to r = .5 and then moving a single dot to see how one data point, a potential outlier, can change the stated correlation value between two variables.\n\n### Pre-lab activity 2: Guess the correlation {#sec-wk11-prelab-guessing-correlations}\n\nNow that you are well versed in interpreting scatterplots (scattergrams) have a go at [**this online app on guessing the correlation**](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/GuessCorrelation.html).\n\nThis is a very basic app that allows you to see how good you are at recognising different correlation strengths from the scatterplots. We would recommend you click the \"Track Performance\" tab so you can keep an overview of your overall bias to underestimate or overestimate a correlation.\n\nIs this all just a bit of fun? Well, yes, because stats is actually fun, and no, because it serves a purpose of helping you determine if the correlations you see in your own data are real, and to help you see if correlations in published research match with what you are being told. As you will have seen from the above examples, one data point can lead to a misleading relationship and even what might be considered a medium to strong relationship may actually have only limited relevance in the real world. One only needs to mention Anscombe's Quartet to be reminded of the importance of visualising your data, which leads us to the final pre-lab activity for this week.\n\n### Pre-lab activity 3: Anscombe's quartet {#sec-wk11-prelab-anscombes-quartet}\n\nAnscombe (1973) showed that four sets of bivariate data (X, Y) that have the exact same means, medians, and relationships can look very different when plotted. You can read more about this [**here**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet).\n\nAll in this is a clear example of why you should visualise your data and not to rely on just the numbers.\n\n### Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class {#sec-wk11-prelab-getting-ready}\n\n#### Remind yourself of the basics of how to work with RStudio and get your files ready\n\nYou might want to re-visit the materials that John and Tom provided in PSYC121:\n\n-   [Basics of working with RStudio](https://lu-psy-r.github.io/statistics_for_psychologists/PSYC121/Week1.html#task-3---using-rstudio)\n\n- Create a folder for Week 11.\n\n- Download the [122_week11_forStudents.zip]() file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created at the previous step. \n\n<!-- (data/week11/122_week11_forStudents.zip) -->\n## Lab activities {#sec-wk11-labactivities}\n\nIn this lab, you'll gain understanding of and practice with:\n\n-   constructing and interpreting scatterplots\n-   running correlation analysis and interpret the results\n-   reporting the results in APA format\n-   constructing a correlation matrix in APA format\n-   when and why to apply correlation analysis to answers questions in psychological science\n\n### Lab activity 1: Interpreting correlation\n\n#### Question 1\n\nBelow are scatterplots that show the relationship between 'how much you know about correlation and how attractive you appear to members of the opposite (&/or same) sex'. Choose the type of correlation (strength and direction) displayed in each graph using one of the following:\n\n-   Perfect positive correlation\n-   Perfect negative correlation\n-   Strong positive correlation\n-   Strong negative correlation\n-   Moderate positive correlation\n-   Moderate negative correlation\n-   Null correlation\n\n**Figure A** ![](images/wk1/lab_act1_a.png)\n\n**Figure B** ![](images/wk1/lab_act1_b.png)\n\n**Figure C** ![](images/wk1/lab_act1_c.png)\n\n**Figure D** ![](images/wk1/lab_act1_d.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nFor the following questions, explain your chosen answer based on the statistic given, not on why you think the correlation may or may note make 'logical' sense.\n:::\n\n#### Question 2\n\nSuppose it was observed that there is a correlation of r = -.81 between a driver's age and the cost of car insurance. This correlation would mean that, in general, older people pay more for car insurance.\n\n**TRUE or FALSE? Explain why.**\n\n#### Question 3\n\nSuppose that there is a correlation of r = .87 between the length of time a person is in prison and the amount of aggression the person displays on a psychological inventory administered at release. This means that spending a longer amount of time in prison *causes* people to become more aggressive.\n\n**TRUE or FALSE? Explain why.**\n\n#### Question 4\n\nA significant correlation was found between having great hair and performance in correlation labs. The correlation coefficient was .7. How much variance in correlation lab performance can the 'greatness' of your hair explain?\n\n-   51%\n-   70%\n-   49%\n-   30%\n-   Who cares I've got great hair.\n\nWhat was the reason for your answer?\n\nWhat is this 'new coefficient' called?\n\nFurther lab activities will be added very soon.\n\n### Lab activity 2: Visualising, calculating and reporting correlations\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Watch the 'How to' video\nIf you haven't done so already, this is a good time to watch the 'How to' video (here @sec-wk11-lectures) on 'How to conduct a correlation analysis using R'.\n:::\n\nGoing back to the data discussed in the 'How to' video (see @sec-wk11-lectures), you'll remember it contains data from 25 8-year-old children on:\n\n-   a standardised test of reading ability (Abil)\n-   intelligence (IQ)\n-   the number of minutes per week spent reading in the home (Home)\n-   and the number of minutes per week spent watching TV (TV)\n\nIn the video on 'How to conduct correlation analysis using R' we looked at the correlation between reading ability and intelligence. Now, let's look at the correlation between number of minutes per week spent reading in the home and watching TV.\n\n::: {.callout-important} \n## Make sure to set your working directory\nThe folder you were asked to download under 'Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class' contains the datafile (\"MillerHadenData.csv\"). Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Set as working directory'.\n:::\n\n0.  Start a new RMarkdown script.

To investigate the relationship, 20 participants completed both the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1993) and the Barratt's Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995). The datafile (\"alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv\") is in the folder you were asked to download under 'Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class'.

The correlation coefficient is a positive number, suggesting a positive relationship between length of time in prison and aggression.
