We will look at how we plot these together on the one graph (using `ggplot()` commands that allow us to share mappings between different geoms. We will explore our data on the famous \"Stroop Task\" and we will use a related-samples t-test to examine the differences between the means of our different conditions in this task.\n\n## Pre-lab work: online tutorial\n\n**Online tutorial**: You must make every attempt to complete this before the lab! To access the [**pre-lab tutorial click here**](https://ma-rconnect.lancs.ac.uk/PSYC121_Week_8/){target=\"_blank\"} (on campus, or VPN required)\n\n**Getting ready for the lab class**\n\n- Create a folder for Week 8 and download the [Week_8 csv file](data/Week_8/stroop_wk8.csv) file and upload it into this new folder in RStudio Server.\n\n## RStudio Tasks\n\n### Task 1 - Examining the distributions and filtering\n\nThe \"Stroop Effect\" is a classic demonstration of automaticity of behaviour. Participants have to say the colour a word is printed in, which is an easy task for a \"compatible\" stimulus like [**GREEN**]{style=\"color:green\"}, and a much more difficult task for an \"incompatible\" stimulus like [**BLUE**]{style=\"color:red\"}. We can't help but read the text - it has seemingly become an automatic process.\n\n![](images/wk8/stroop.png) In this task we will calculate the means and standard errors of the means and then we will then plot them using ggplot(). First though, we'll need to inspect the data and maybe do a bit of data wrangling by using our `filter()` command.\n\n1.  Create a new R Markdown document. If you're unsure about this step, see the instructions from Week 6 (or 7).\n\n2.  As usual, add a code chunk with `library(tidyverse)` and a `read_csv` command (see above for the link to the csv). Assign the result to a new data object, and call your data something meaningful (perhaps *data_w8* or *data_stroop* but maybe not *bestest_most_fantastic_data_on_the_stroop_test_eva_init*)\n\n3.  View the data with `View(data_object_name)`. You will see that the data are a little different from the data we have worked with previously. We have an *pID* variable, which gives a unique number for each person, but each person has 3 rows of data. This is because the different conditions of the Stroop task reflect a **within-subjects variable** (related samples). For data like this it is often useful to have them arranged in what is referred to as **\"long format\"**, with multiple rows for each response the participant provides. For the current data that means we have a variable called *condition*, which is our IV, and one called *time* which is our DV. We also have a column labelled *avg_time*, which is the average of the 3 time values for each participant (the data is duplicated, which is both normal and necessary with long format data).\n\n4.  Let's look at the distribution of *time* (our DV) as a function of *condition*. Add another chunk of code and include the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# distribution of times by condition\nyour_data_object %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_density(aes(x = missing_column_name_A, fill = missing_column_name_B), alpha = .8) + # you need to EDIT this for Q4\n  theme_dark()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n5. You'll need to \"map\" *x* to *time* and *fill* to *condition* for our `geom_density()` plot. You can play around with the *alpha* parameter (which sets the transparency of the elements of the graph), setting it to a value between 0 and 1. Note that this is done OUTSIDE of the `aes()` command.\n\n6.  From the density plot, it does seem like we have some outlier values. It's probably best if we remove data for the whole participant if their *average* time is unusual. To do that, we'll look at the data using the *avg_time* column. Add the following code for a `geom_histogram()` to plot the distribution of values in the new *avg_time* column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# distribution of average times\nyour_data_object %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = missing_column_name_A), fill = \"pink\") + # you need to EDIT this line\n  theme_classic()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n7.  Let's use the filter command we learned last week to remove these high values. Like last week, we will do this (for now) in a fairly unprincipled manner, by \"eyeballing\" the data (next week we'll consider something a bit more \"scientific\"). Complete the filter command so that it keeps only the responses for people that had an `avg_time` less than 12 seconds. Remember that you need to think about how you are storing the result of this filter process. Do you want to create a new object, or overwrite the existing object? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# filter out the high values\nnew_data_object <- # create a new object (or overwrite)\n  your_data_object %>% # original data object \n  filter(insert_an_expression_here)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true title=\"Check your result!\"}\nIf you've done this correctly, you should now have a data object that has **360 rows** (data for 120 participants, with 3 responses each). \n:::\n\n8. Add and edit the following code to plot a histogram of the *filtered* data.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# draw a histogram of the filtered data \nnew_data_object %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = missing_columns_name), \n                 fill = \"pink\", # try some different colours?\n                 colour = \"purple\", # and here?\n                 bins = 3) #  # adjust the bins? \n# you could also add (+) a theme to this plot! \n# for a list of themes, type: ?theme_classic\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n9. Finally, copy the code for the original `geom_density()` plot that you drew in step 4. Paste it, and edit the code so that it now plots the filtered set of data (from step 7) for each of the three conditions in the stroop task. \n\n### Task 2 - Running related samples t-tests\n\nWe have seen in our density plots that the reaction times (DV) look different in the three different Stroop conditions (our IV). But now we need to look at whether there are **statistically significant differences** between the means of the three conditions.\n\nTo do this, we will first summarise the mean time taken by each condition in the Stroop task. [Remember from Week 3](#group_by) that we can use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to get summary stats (e.g., mean, sd) at each level of the IV. That's what we want to do now:\n\n1.  Copy the code below into your R Markdown and edit the `group_by()` line to specify the IV and the `summarise()` line to calculate the `mean()` of our DV. If you do this correctly, you'll get three values - a mean value for each level (condition) of our IV. Do these means reflect what you would expect in the Stroop task? Do they match the central tendency of the distributions you plotted?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nname_of_data_object %>%\n  group_by(name_of_IV_column) %>% # you need to EDIT this for Q1\n  summarise(stroop_mean = mean(name_of_DV_column)) # you need to EDIT this for Q1\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  Next we need to test if these differences between our means are real. To do that, we can run a related samples t-test; remember that the data for each level of the IV in this experiment came from the same person. We must use a `filter()` to restrict the data to just two levels of the IV: the *condition* column/variable in the data. This is because a related samples t-test looks at the difference between two means (and only two), so the column we use for the t-test needs to have just two levels of the IV (two of the conditions).\n\n3.  Copy the code below into your R Markdown. The filter command is already set up to restrict the data to two of the conditions. Note that the filter uses an \"\\|\" symbol, which means \"or\", because we want the data that **is the same as** (==) one condition OR **is the same as** (==) the other condition. You'll need to edit the name of the data object to get this to run. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# use filter to select two levels of the IV - Q3-5\nstroop_comparison <-\n  name_of_data_object %>% # Edit this for the name of YOUR data object\n  filter(condition == \"compatible\" | condition == \"incompatible\")\n\n# run the t-test comparing the means of these two levels\nt.test(data = stroop_comparison, time ~ condition, paired = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n4.  Run the t-test on this selection of data to compare the means from these two levels of the IV. Is the result significant? Note the t-value and the p-value.\n\n5.  Write out a statement in your R Markdown document to express this result. Here's a template you can use, where you need to edit the bits in the \\[\\]:\n\n> \"There \\[was a / was no\\] significant difference between the \\[describe the variables that were compared\\], t(\\[degrees of freedom here\\]) = \\[t value here\\], p \\< \\[p value here\\].\"\n\n6.  With 3 levels to the IV *condition* there are 3 possible comparisons we can make (L1 vs. L2; L1 vs. L3; L2 vs. L3). Complete all three tests, by copying the code chunk, editing it to make a different filter selection, and then running the t-test. Write out a reporting statement (Q5) for each of your comparisons.\n\n### Task 3 - Plotting the means and SEs\n\n1.  In Task 2 you calculated the means for each condition in the Stroop task. We've seen in lectures that \"standard error\" provides an estimate of how variable that mean will be across the samples we collect. A very typical way to plot a mean value is to plot it with the standard error of the mean (SEM):\n\n![](images/wk8/error_bars.png)\n\n2.  The code from Task 2, Question 1 will give the mean. We will now add a second line of this code to give the standard error values:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nname_of_data_object %>%\n  group_by(name_of_IV_column) %>% # you need to EDIT this for Q2\n  summarise(stroop_mean = mean(name_of_DV_column),\n            stroop_SE = sd(name_of_DV_column)/sqrt(n())) # you need to EDIT this for Q1\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n3. Add this code to your document and the correct column (DV) to both the `sd()` and the `mean()` commands. Note that you don't need to put anything in `n()`, as this simply calculates how many rows there are.\n\n4.  View the new summary object you have created. Check that the means and SEs are different for the 3 conditions. If they are the same, you probably summarised the wrong column!\n\n5.  We will now plot these 3 mean values in a figure. Let's use `geom_point()` so that our means and SEs look a bit like the figure above. Complete the ggplot command to plot our summarised value called *stroop_mean* (y), as a function of the IV, *condition* (x):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# let's first plot the means\nname_of_data_object %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = name_of_IV_column, y = name_of_DV_column)) + # map variables to x and y for Q5\n  geom_point(size = 5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n6.  Now we need to add some \"error bars\" which provide a visual guide as to how much uncertainty we have in our mean value. Edit the code below for the `ggplot()` command to plot both `geom_point()` (same as Q5) and `geom_errorbar`. You will need to calculate a `ymin` and a `ymax` value. \n\n::: {.callout-important icon=true title=\"Plotting the error bars\"}\n\nUse the illustration of the error bars above to work out how to combine the mean value and the SE value (hint: you'll need to either ADD or SUBTRACT for the two statements) to create the right `ymin` and `ymax`. You need to put this in the \"missing_equation\" bit of the code below: \n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# let's first plot the means\nname_of_data_object %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = name_of_IV_column, y = name_of_DV_column)) + # map variables to x and y for Q5\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = missing_equation, # edit this for Q5\n                    ymax = missing_equation), # edit this for Q5\n                width = .2) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nEXTRA: These next steps can be completed to practice customising your plot\n\n6.  Add a `labs()` layer to the plot to change the axis titles, and the title of the plot.\n\n7.  Change the theme of the plot (e.g., `theme_void()`)\n\n8.  Map the *fill* aesthetic to the variable *stroop_condition*. You can do this for `geom_point` or `geom_errorbar` or both at once by putting it in the `aes()` within the `ggplot()` command.\n\n9.  Manually change the colours of the columns with using `scale_fill_brewer()`. Take a look at the Week 6 (6.3.7) for instructions on setting colours.\n\n10. Try changing your `geom_point()` to `geom_col`.\n\n### Task 4 - Knit the document\n\nLet's try knitting the document. If you've done everything right, then the knitting process will work and you'll get a nice output (in html, or PDF, whichever you choose). If something goes wrong, here's a few things you can check\n\n- Did you keep all your code in the code chunks?\n\n- Check all your code blocks run.\n\n- Are there any red cross symbols next to your lines of code? These inidcate a code error and need to be fixed before it will knit. \n\nWhen you knit the document, you will probably see the code you have written in the output. You can decide whether you want to present the code or not using the options for each code chunk:\n\n![](images/wk8/chunk_options.png)\n\nClick the cog, then select the type of output you want each code to produce. \n\nKnitting the document is a great way to see how your work functions as an actual report. Go back and add more description between your code chunks to describe all the steps you have performed in your analysis. \n\n\n## Week 8 Quiz\n\nYou can access a set of quiz questions related to this week [here.](https://ma-rconnect.lancs.ac.uk/PSYC121_2022_Week_8_Quiz/){target=\"_blank\"}\n",
